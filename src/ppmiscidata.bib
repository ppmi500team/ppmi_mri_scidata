	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Classic Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by fibrillar alpha-synuclein inclusions known as Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra, which are associated with nigrostriatal degeneration. However, alpha-synuclein pathologies accumulate throughout the CNS in areas that also undergo progressive neurodegeneration, leading to dementia and other behavioral impairments in addition to parkinsonism. Although mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene only cause Lewy body PD in rare families, and although there are multiple other, albeit rare, genetic causes of familial parkinsonism, sporadic Lewy body PD is the most common movement disorder, and insights into mechanisms underlying alpha-synuclein-mediated neurodegeneration provide novel targets for the discovery of disease-modifying therapies for PD and related neurodegenerative alpha-synucleinopathies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Multi-start methods strategically sample the solution space of an optimization problem. The most successful of these methods have two phases that are alternated for a certain number of global iterations. The first phase generates a solution and the second seeks to improve the outcome. Each global iteration produces a solution that is typically a local optimum, and the best overall solution is the output of the algorithm. The interaction between the two phases creates a balance between search diversification (structural variation) and search intensification (improvement), to yield an effective means for generating high-quality solutions. This survey briefly sketches historical developments that have motivated the field, and then focuses on modern contributions that define the current state-of-the-art. We consider two categories of multi-start methods: memory-based and memoryless procedures. The former are based on identifying and recording specific types of information (attributes) to exploit in future constructions. The latter are based on order statistics of sampling and generate unconnected solutions. An interplay between the features of these two categories provides an inviting area for future exploration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Inter-modality covariation leveraged as a scientific principle can inform the development of novel hypotheses and increase statistical power in the analysis of diverse data. We present similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR), an algorithm that exploits inter-modality relationships to transform large scientific datasets into smaller, more well-powered and intepretable low-dimensional spaces. Novel aspects of this methodology include its objective function for identifying joint signal, an efficient approach based on sparse matrices for representing prior within-modality relationships and an efficient implementation that allows SiMLR to be applied to relatively large datasets with multiple modalities, each of which may have millions of entries. We first describe and contextualize SiMLR theory and implementation strategies. We then illustrate the method in simulated data to establish its expected performance. Subsequently, we demonstrate succinct SiMLR case studies, and compare with related methods, in publicly accessible example datasets. Lastly, we use SiMLR to derive a neurobiological embedding from three types of measurements - two measurements from structural neuroimaging complemented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 44 depression and anxiety-related loci [1]. We find that, in a validation dataset, the low-dimensional space from the training set exhibits above-chance relationships with clinical measurements of anxiety and, to a lesser degree, depression. The results suggest that SiMLR is able to derive a low-dimensional representation space that, in suitable datasets, may be clinically relevant. Taken together, this collection of results shows that SiMLR may be applied with default parameters to joint signal estimation from disparate modalities and may yield practically useful results.},

	abstract = {Importance: Corticolimbic patterns of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation define neuropathologic subtypes of Alzheimer disease (AD), which underlie the clinical heterogeneity observed antemortem. The cholinergic system, which is the target of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy, is selectively vulnerable in AD. Objective: To investigate the major source of cholinergic innervation, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), in order to determine whether there is differential involvement of NFT accumulation or neuronal loss among AD subtypes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, retrospective abstraction of clinical records and quantitative assessment of NFTs and neuron counts in the nbM was completed in January 2019 at the Mayo Clinic using the Florida Autopsied Multi-Ethnic (FLAME) cohort, which had been accessioned from 1991 until 2015. The FLAME cohort is derived from the deeded autopsy program funded throughout the State of Florida's memory disorder clinic referral services. Of the 2809 consecutively accessioned FLAME cohort, 1464 were identified as neuropathologically diagnosed AD cases and nondemented normal controls available for clinicopathologic assessment. Quantification of NFTs and neuronal density in the anterior nbM was performed blinded to neuropathologic groupings. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic and clinical characteristics, including cognitive decline measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination score (range, 0-30), were evaluated. The anterior nbM was investigated quantitatively for neuronal loss and NFT accumulation. Results: In total, 1361 AD subtypes and 103 nondemented controls were assessed. The median (interquartile range) age at death was 72 (66-80) years in hippocampal sparing (HpSp) AD, 81 (76-86) years in typical AD, and 86 (82-90) years in limbic predominant AD. The median (interquartile range) count per 0.125 mm2 of thioflavin S-positive NFTs was highest in the nbM of HpSp AD (14 [9-20]; n = 163), lower in typical AD (10 [5-16]; n = 937), and lowest in limbic predominant AD (8 [5-11], n = 163) (P {\textbackslash}textless.001). The median (interquartile range) neuronal density per millimeters squared was lowest in HpSp AD cases (22 [17-28]; n = 148), higher in typical AD (25 [19-30]; n = 727), and highest in limbic predominant AD (26 [19-32]; n = 127) (P =.002). Multivariable regression modeling of clinical and demographic variables was performed to assess overlap in NFT accumulation and neuronal density differences among AD subtypes. Higher NFT accumulation in the nbM was associated with younger age at onset for HpSp AD (beta, -1.5; 95\% CI, -2.9 to -0.15; P =.03) and typical AD (beta, -3.2; 95\% CI, -3.9 to -2.4; P {\textbackslash}textless.001). In addition, higher NFT accumulation in the nbM of typical AD cases was associated with female sex (beta, 2.5; 95\% CI, 1.4-3.5; P {\textbackslash}textless.001), apolipoprotein E ϵ4 allele (beta, 1.3; 95\% CI, 0.15-2.5; P =.03), and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (beta, -1.8; 95\% CI, -3.2 to -0.31; P =.02). Demographic and clinical progression variables were not associated with NFT accumulation in the nbM of limbic predominant AD cases. Conclusions and Relevance: These data provide supportive evidence that NFT accumulation in the nbM may underlie more widespread and severe cholinergic deficits in young-onset AD, in particular in patients with HpSp AD. Moreover, these findings underscore the importance of considering age at onset, sex, and apolipoprotein E genotype when assessing outcomes in AD.},

Recent neuroimage investigations reported disruptive brain white matter connectivity in both iRBD and PD, respectively. However, the intrinsic process of the human brain structural network evolving from iRBD to PD still remains largely unknown. To address this issue, 151 participants including iRBD, PD and age-matched normal controls were recruited to receive diffusion MRI scans and neuropsychological examinations. The connectome-wide association analysis was performed to detect reorganization of brain structural network along with PD progression. Eight brain seed regions in both cortical and subcortical areas demonstrated significant structural pattern changes along with the progression of PD. Applying machine learning on the key connectivity related to these seed regions demonstrated better classification accuracy compared to conventional network-based statistic. Our study shows that connectome-wide association analysis reveals the underlying structural connectivity patterns related to the progression of PD, and provide a promising distinct capability to predict prodromal PD patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Image registration is one of the most important and universally useful computational tasks in biomedical image analysis. A recent article by Xing \& Qiu (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33(10):2081-2092, 2011) is based on an inappropriately narrow conceptualization of the image registration problem as the task of making two images look alike, which disregards whether the established spatial correspondence is plausible. The authors propose a new algorithm, Nonparametric Local Smoothing (NLS) for image registration, but use image similarities alone as a measure of registration performance, although these measures do not relate reliably to the realism of the correspondence map. Results: Using data obtained from its authors, we show experimentally that the method proposed by Xing \& Qiu is not an effective registration algorithm. While it optimizes image similarity, it does not compute accurate, interpretable transformations. Even judged by image similarity alone, the proposed method is consistently outperformed by a simple pixel permutation algorithm, which is known by design not to compute valid registrations. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that the NLS algorithm proposed recently for image registration, and published in one of the most respected journals in computer science, is not, in fact, an effective registration method at all. Our results also emphasize the general need to apply registration evaluation criteria that are sensitive to whether correspondences are accurate and mappings between images are physically interpretable. These goals cannot be achieved by simply reporting image similarities. © 2012 Rohlfing and Avants; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that cortical and hippocampal volumes, measured in vivo from volumetric MRI (vMRI) scans, could be used to identify variant subtypes of Alzheimer disease (AD) and to prospectively predict the rate of clinical decline. Methods: Amyloid-positive participants with AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1 and ADNI2 with baseline MRI scans (n = 229) and 2-year clinical follow-up (n = 100) were included. AD subtypes (hippocampal sparing [HpSpMRI], limbic predominant [LPMRI], typical AD [tADMRI]) were defined according to an algorithm analogous to one recently proposed for tau neuropathology. Relationships between baseline hippocampal volume to cortical volume ratio (HV:CTV) and clinical variables were examined by both continuous regression and categorical models. Results: When participants were divided categorically, the HpSpMRI group showed significantly more AD-like hypometabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) and poorer baseline executive function (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Other baseline clinical measures did not differ across the 3 groups. Participants with HpSpMRI also showed faster subsequent clinical decline than participants with LPMRI on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, 13-Item Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (all p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) and tADMRI on the MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) (both p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Finally, a larger HV:CTV was associated with poorer baseline executive function and a faster slope of decline in CDR-SB, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog13 score (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). These associations were driven mostly by the amount of cortical rather than hippocampal atrophy. Conclusions: AD subtypes with phenotypes consistent with those observed with tau neuropathology can be identified in vivo with vMRI. An increased HV:CTV ratio was predictive of faster clinical decline in participants with AD who were clinically indistinguishable at baseline except for a greater dysexecutive presentation.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning from natural image to medical image has established as one of the most practical paradigms in deep learning for medical image analysis. However, to fit this paradigm, 3D imaging tasks in the most prominent imaging modalities (e.g., CT and MRI) have to be reformulated and solved in 2D, losing rich 3D anatomical information and inevitably compromising the performance. To overcome this limitation, we have built a set of models, called Generic Autodidactic Models, nicknamed Models Genesis, because they are created ex nihilo (with no manual labeling), self-taught (learned by self-supervision), and generic (served as source models for generating application-specific target models). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our Models Genesis significantly outperform learning from scratch in all five target 3D applications covering both segmentation and classification. More importantly, learning a model from scratch simply in 3D may not necessarily yield performance better than transfer learning from ImageNet in 2D, but our Models Genesis consistently top any 2D approaches including fine-tuning the models pre-trained from ImageNet as well as fine-tuning the 2D versions of our Models Genesis, confirming the importance of 3D anatomical information and significance of our Models Genesis for 3D medical imaging. This performance is attributed to our unified self-supervised learning framework, built on a simple yet powerful observation: the sophisticated yet recurrent anatomy in medical images can serve as strong supervision signals for deep models to learn common anatomical representation automatically via self-supervision. As open science, all pre-trained Models Genesis are available at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/ModelsGenesis.},

At POST3, lobar air volume increased 83-148\% and tissue (including microvascular blood) volume 120-234\% above PRE values without further changes at POST15. Lobar-specific compliance (Cs) increased 52-137\% from PRE to POST3 and 28-79\% from POST3 to POST15. Inflation-related parenchyma strain and shear were estimated by detailed registration of corresponding anatomical features at each Ptp. Within each lobe, regional displacement was most pronounced at the caudal region, whereas strain was pronounced in the periphery. Regional three-dimensional strain magnitudes increased heterogeneously from PRE to POST3, with further medial-lateral increases from POST3 to POST15. Lobar principal strains (PSs) were unchanged or modestly elevated postresection; changes in lobar maximum PS correlated inversely with changes in lobar air and tissue volumes. Lobar shear distortion increased in coronal and transverse planes at POST3 without further changes thereafter. These results establish a novel use of functional HRCT to map heterogeneous regional deformation during compensatory lung growth and illustrate a stimulus-response feedback loop whereby postresection mechanical stress initiates differential lobar regrowth and sustained remodeling, which in turn, relieves parenchyma stress and strain, resulting in progressive increases in lobar Cs and a delayed increase in whole lung Cs.},

	abstract = {While many neuroscience questions aim to understand the human brain, much current knowledge has been gained using animal models, which replicate genetic, structural, and connectivity aspects of the human brain. While voxel-based analysis (VBA) of preclinical magnetic resonance images is widely-used, a thorough examination of the statistical robustness, stability, and error rates is hindered by high computational demands of processing large arrays, and the many parameters involved. Thus, workflows are often based on intuition or experience, while preclinical validation studies remain scarce. To increase throughput and reproducibility of quantitative small animal brain studies, we have developed a publicly shared, high throughput VBA pipeline in a high-performance computing environment, called SAMBA. The increased computational efficiency allowed large multidimensional arrays to be processed in 1-3 days-a task that previously took ∼1 month. To quantify the variability and reliability of preclinical VBA in rodent models, we propose a validation framework consisting of morphological phantoms, and four metrics. This addresses several sources that impact VBA results, including registration and template construction strategies. We have used this framework to inform the VBA workflow parameters in a VBA study for a mouse model of epilepsy. We also present initial efforts towards standardizing small animal neuroimaging data in a similar fashion with human neuroimaging. We conclude that verifying the accuracy of VBA merits attention, and should be the focus of a broader effort within the community. The proposed framework promotes consistent quality assurance of VBA in preclinical neuroimaging; facilitating the creation and communication of robust results.},

Onto this latent feature space, we project the data in related domains where we can ap-ply standard learning algorithms to train classification or regression models. Thus, the latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new di-mensionality reduction method to find a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions of the data in different domains in a latent space.

	abstract = {Semantic segmentation of medical images aims to associate a pixel with a label in a medical image without human initialization. The success of semantic segmentation algorithms is contingent on the availability of high-quality imaging data with corresponding labels provided by experts. We sought to create a large collection of annotated medical image datasets of various clinically relevant anatomies available under open source license to facilitate the development of semantic segmentation algorithms. Such a resource would allow: 1) objective assessment of general-purpose segmentation methods through comprehensive benchmarking and 2) open and free access to medical image data for any researcher interested in the problem domain. Through a multi-institutional effort, we generated a large, curated dataset representative of several highly variable segmentation tasks that was used in a crowd-sourced challenge - the Medical Segmentation Decathlon held during the 2018 Medical Image Computing and Computer Aided Interventions Conference in Granada, Spain. Here, we describe these ten labeled image datasets so that these data may be effectively reused by the research community.},

	abstract = {We present and evaluate a new method for automatically labeling the subfields of the hippocampal formation in focal 0.4×0.5×2.0mm3 resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that can be acquired in the routine clinical setting with under 5min scan time. The method combines multi-atlas segmentation, similarity-weighted voting, and a novel learning-based bias correction technique to achieve excellent agreement with manual segmentation. Initial partitioning of MRI slices into hippocampal 'head', 'body' and 'tail' slices is the only input required from the user, necessitated by the nature of the underlying segmentation protocol. Dice overlap between manual and automatic segmentation is above 0.87 for the larger subfields, CA1 and dentate gyrus, and is competitive with the best results for whole-hippocampus segmentation in the literature. Intraclass correlation of volume measurements in CA1 and dentate gyrus is above 0.89. Overlap in smaller hippocampal subfields is lower in magnitude (0.54 for CA2, 0.62 for CA3, 0.77 for subiculum and 0.79 for entorhinal cortex) but comparable to overlap between manual segmentations by trained human raters. These results support the feasibility of subfield-specific hippocampal morphometry in clinical studies of memory and neurodegenerative disease. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	abstract = {The present study examined the organization of complex familiar activities, known as "scripts" (e.g., "going fishing"). We assessed whether events in a script are processed in a linear-sequential manner or clustered-hierarchical manner, and we evaluated the neural basis for this processing capacity. Converging evidence was obtained from functional neuroimaging in healthy young adults and from behavioral and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in patients with focal neurodegenerative disease. In both studies, participants judged the order of consecutive event pairs taken from a script. Event pairs either were clustered together within a script or were from different clusters within the script. Controls judged events more accurately and quickly if taken from the same cluster within a script compared with different clusters, even though all event pairs were consecutive, consistent with the hierarchical organization of a script. Functional magnetic resonance imaging associated this with bilateral inferior frontal activation. Patients with progressive nonfluent aphasia or behavior-variant frontotemporal dementia did not distinguish between event pairs from the same cluster or from different clusters within a script. Structural MRI associated this deficit with significant frontal cortical atrophy. Our findings suggest that frontal cortex contributes to clustering events during script comprehension, underlining the role of frontal cortex in the hierarchical organization of a script. © The Authors 2010.},

However, there are many registration algorithms to choose from. A recent evaluation of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods, as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than 16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels, registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following: 1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration; and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods using present resampling methods. From the results of this study, we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template. © 2010.},

Objective: To investigate the relationship between midbrain nuclei volume as an in vivo biomarker for surviving neurons in mild-to-moderate patients using 7.0 Tesla MRI. Methods: We performed ultra-high resolution quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) on the midbrain in 32 PD participants with less than 10 years duration and 8 healthy controls. Following blinded manual segmentation, the individual volumes of the SN, subthalamic nucleus, and red nucleus were measured. We then determined the associations between the midbrain nuclei and clinical metrics (age, disease duration, MDS-UPDRS motor score, and subscores for bradykinesia/rigidity, tremor, and postural instability/gait difficulty). Results: We found that smaller SN correlated with longer disease duration (r =-0.49, p = 0.004), more severe MDS-UPDRS motor score (r =-0.42, p = 0.016), and more severe bradykinesia-rigidity subscore (r =-0.47, p = 0.007), but not tremor or postural instability/gait difficulty subscores. In a hemi-body analysis, bradykinesia-rigidity severity only correlated with SN contralateral to the less-affected hemi-body, and not contralateral to the more-affected hemi-body, possibly reflecting the greatest change in dopamine neuron loss early in disease. Multivariate generalized estimating equation model confirmed that bradykinesia-rigidity severity, age, and disease duration, but not tremor severity, predicted SN volume. Conclusions: In mild-to-moderate PD, SN volume relates to motor manifestations in a motor domain-specific and laterality-dependent manner. Non-invasive in vivo 7.0 Tesla QSM may serve as a biomarker in longitudinal studies of SN atrophy and in studies of people at risk for developing PD.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a single validated model for survival in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) using a comprehensive international database. Experimental Design: A comprehensive database of 3,748 patients including previously reported clinical prognostic factors was established by pooling patient-level data from clinical trials. Following quality control and standardization, descriptive statistics were generated. Univariate analyses were conducted using proportional hazards models. Multivariable analysis using a log-logistic model stratified by center and multivariable fractional polynomials was conducted to identify independent predictors of survival. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation methods. Three risk groups were formed using the 25th and 75th percentiles of the resulting prognostic index. The model was validated using an independent data set of 645 patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Results: Median survival in the favorable, intermediate and poor risk groups was 26.9 months, 11.5 months, and 4.2 months, respectively. Factors contributing to the prognostic index included treatment, performance status, number of metastatic sites, time from diagnosis to treatment, and pretreatment hemoglobin, white blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and serum calcium. The model showed good concordance when tested among patients treated with TKI therapy (C statistic=0.741, 95\% CI: 0.714-0.768). Conclusions: Nine clinical factors can be used to model survival in mRCC and form distinct prognostic groups. The model shows utility among patients treated in the TKI era. ©2011 AACR.},

	abstract = {Bayesian regularization of artificial neural networks (BRANNs) were used to predict body mass index (BMI) in mice using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Data from 1896 animals with both phenotypic and genotypic (12 320 loci) information were used for the analysis. Missing genotypes were imputed based on estimated allelic frequencies, with no attempt to reconstruct haplotypes based on family information or linkage disequilibrium between markers. A feed-forward multilayer perceptron network consisting of a single output layer and one hidden layer was used. Training of the neural network was done using the Bayesian regularized backpropagation algorithm. When the number of neurons in the hidden layer was increased, the number of effective parameters, γ, increased up to a point and stabilized thereafter. A model with five neurons in the hidden layer produced a value of γ that saturated the data. In terms of predictive ability, a network with five neurons in the hidden layer attained the smallest error and highest correlation in the test data although differences among networks were negligible. Using inherent weight information of BRANN with different number of neurons in the hidden layer, it was observed that 17 SNPs had a larger impact on the network, indicating their possible relevance in prediction of BMI. It is concluded that BRANN may be at least as useful as other methods for high-dimensional genome-enabled prediction, with the advantage of its potential ability of capturing non-linear relationships, which may be useful in the study of quantitative traits under complex gene action. © Cambridge University Press 2011.},

	abstract = {Background: Periventricular leukoaraiosis may be an important pathological change in postural instability gait disorder (PIGD), a motor subtype of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical diagnosis of PIGD may be challenging for the general neurologist. Purpose: To evaluate 1) the utility of a fully automated volume-based morphometry (Vol-BM) in characterizing imaging diagnostic markers in PD and PIGD, including, 2) novel deep gray nuclear lesion load (GMab), and 3) discriminatory performance of a Vol-BM model construct in classifying the PIGD subtype. Study Type: Prospective. Subjects: In all, 23 PIGD, 21 PD, and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC) underwent MRI brain scans and clinical assessments. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T, sagittal 3D-magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging (FLAIR) sequences. Assessment: Clinical assessment was conducted by a movement disorder neurologist. The MR brain images were then segmented using an automated multimodal Vol-BM algorithm (MorphoBox) and reviewed by two authors independently. Statistical Testing: Brain segmentation and clinical parameter differences and dependence were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to differentiate PIGD from PD, and discriminative reliability was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Significantly higher white matter lesion load (WMab) (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01), caudate GMab (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05), and lateral and third ventricular (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) volumetry were found in PIGD, compared with PD and HC. WMab, caudate and putamen GMab, and caudate, lateral, and third ventricular volumetry showed significant coefficients (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.005) in linear regressions with balance and gait assessments in both patient groups. A model incorporating WMab, caudate GMab, and caudate GM discriminated PIGD from PD and HC with a sensitivity = 0.83 and specificity = 0.76 (AUC = 0.84). Data Conclusion: Fast, unbiased quantification of microstructural brain changes in PD and PIGD is feasible using automated Vol-BM. Composite lesion load in the white matter and caudate, and caudate volumetry discriminated PIGD from PD and HC, and showed potential in classification of these disorders using supervised machine learning.

As malignant tumors with similar morphological characteristics have been shown to exhibit entirely different molecular profiles, there has been significant interest in using multiple 'omic data for the identification of novel molecular subtypes of disease, which could impact treatment decisions. Therefore, we have developed intNMF, an integrative approach for disease subtype classification based on non-negative matrix factorization. The proposed approach carries out integrative clustering of multiple high dimensional molecular data in a single comprehensive analysis utilizing the information across multiple biological levels assessed on the same individual. As intNMFdoes not assume any distributional form for the data, it has obvious advantages over other model based clustering methods which require specific distributional assumptions. Application of intNMF is illustrated using both simulated and real data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).},

	abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is becoming increasingly popular for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. While ICA has been successfully applied to single-subject analysis, the extension of ICA to group inferences is not straightforward and remains an active topic of research. Current group ICA models, such as the GIFT [Calhoun, V.D., Adali, T., Pearlson, G.D., Pekar, J.J., 2001. A method for making group inferences from functional MRI data using independent component analysis. Hum. Brain Mapp. 14, 140-151.] and tensor PICA [Beckmann, C.F., Smith, S.M., 2005. Tensorial extensions of independent component analysis for multisubject FMRI analysis. Neuroimage 25, 294-311.], make different assumptions about the underlying structure of the group spatio-temporal processes and are thus estimated using algorithms tailored for the assumed structure, potentially leading to diverging results. To our knowledge, there are currently no methods for assessing the validity of different model structures in real fMRI data and selecting the most appropriate one among various choices. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for estimating and comparing group ICA models with varying spatio-temporal structures. We consider a class of group ICA models that can accommodate different group structures and include existing models, such as the GIFT and tensor PICA, as special cases. We propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach with a modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the estimation of the proposed class of models. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) are presented to compare between different group ICA models. The LRT can be used to perform model comparison and selection, to assess the goodness-of-fit of a model in a particular data set, and to test group differences in the fMRI signal time courses between subject subgroups. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under varying structures of group spatio-temporal processes. We illustrate our group ICA method using data from an fMRI study that investigates changes in neural processing associated with the regular practice of Zen meditation.},

Previous studies have reported relationships between FOG, substantia nigra (SN) degeneration, dopamine transporter (DAT) concentration, as well as amyloid beta deposition. However, there is a paucity of research on the concurrent impact of white matter damage. Objectives: To assess the inter-relationships between these different co-morbidities, their impact on future FOG and whether they act independently of each other. Methods: We used baseline MRI and longitudinal gait data from 423 de novo PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We used deformation based morphometry (DBM) from T1-weighted MRI to measure SN atrophy, and segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) as a measure of WM pathological load. Putamen and caudate DAT levels from SPECT as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta were obtained directly from the PPMI. Following correlation analyses, we investigated whether WMH burden mediates the impact of amyloid beta on future FOG. Results: SN DBM, WMH load, putamen and caudate DAT activity and CSF amyloid beta levels were significantly different between PD patients with and without future FOG (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.008). Mediation analysis demonstrated an effect of CSF amyloid beta levels on future FOG via WMH load, independent of SN atrophy and striatal DAT activity levels. Conclusions: Amyloid beta might impact future FOG in PD patients through an increase in WMH burden, in a pathway independent of Lewy body pathology.},

In contrast to the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user to parameterize the data (e.g. the brain's response to stimuli), ICA, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response. In addition, ICA is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. There are a wide variety of ICA approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software. In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials. As demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ICA is a powerful and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain.},

	abstract = {Sophisticated image analysis methods have been developed for the human brain, but such tools still need to be adapted and optimized for quantitative small animal imaging. We propose a framework for quantitative anatomical phenotyping in mouse models of neurological and psychiatric conditions. The framework encompasses an atlas space, image acquisition protocols, and software tools to register images into this space. We show that a suite of segmentation tools (Avants, Epstein et al., 2008) designed for human neuroimaging can be incorporated into a pipeline for segmenting mouse brain images acquired with multispectral magnetic resonance imaging (MR) protocols. We present a flexible approach for segmenting such hyperimages, optimizing registration, and identifying optimal combinations of image channels for particular structures. Brain imaging with T1, T2* and T2 contrasts yielded accuracy in the range of 83\% for hippocampus and caudate putamen (Hc and CPu), but only 54\% in white matter tracts, and 44\% for the ventricles. The addition of diffusion tensor parameter images improved accuracy for large gray matter structures (by {\textbackslash}textgreater5\%), white matter (10\%), and ventricles (15\%). The use of Markov random field segmentation further improved overall accuracy in the C57BL/6 strain by 6\%; so Dice coefficients for Hc and CPu reached 93\%, for white matter 79\%, for ventricles 68\%, and for substantia nigra 80\%. We demonstrate the segmentation pipeline for the widely used C57BL/6 strain, and two test strains (BXD29, APP/TTA). This approach appears promising for characterizing temporal changes in mouse models of human neurological and psychiatric conditions, and may provide anatomical constraints for other preclinical imaging, e.g. fMRI and molecular imaging.

	doi = {10.1049/iet-bmt.2017.0147},
	abstract = {Since its introduction in 2014, the face morphing forgery (FMF) attack has received significant attention from the biometric and media forensic research communities. The attack aims at creating artificially weakened templates which can be successfully matched against multiple persons. If successful, the attack has an immense impact on many biometric authentication scenarios including the application of electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD) at automated border control gates. We extend the StirTrace framework for benchmarking FMF attacks by adding five issues: a novel threefold definition for the quality of morphed images, a novel FMF realisation (combined morphing), a post-processing operation to simulate the digital image format used in eMRTD (passport scaling 15 kB), an automated face recognition system (VGG face descriptor) as additional means for biometric quality assessment and two feature spaces for FMF detection (keypoint features and fusion of keypoint and Benford features) as additional means for forensic quality assessment. We show that the impact of StirTrace post-processing operations on the biometric quality of morphed face images is negligible except for two noise operators and passport scaling 15 kB, the impact on the forensic quality depends on the type of post-processing, and the new FMF realisation outperforms the previously considered ones.},

	abstract = {The neuro-anatomical substrates of major depressive disorder (MDD) are still not well understood, despite many neuroimaging studies over the past few decades. Here we present the largest ever worldwide study by the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Major Depressive Disorder Working Group on cortical structural alterations in MDD. Structural T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 2148 MDD patients and 7957 healthy controls were analysed with harmonized protocols at 20 sites around the world. To detect consistent effects of MDD and its modulators on cortical thickness and surface area estimates derived from MRI, statistical effects from sites were meta-analysed separately for adults and adolescents. Adults with MDD had thinner cortical gray matter than controls in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior and posterior cingulate, insula and temporal lobes (Cohen's d effect sizes: -0.10 to -0.14). These effects were most pronounced in first episode and adult-onset patients ({\textbackslash}textgreater21 years). Compared to matched controls, adolescents with MDD had lower total surface area (but no differences in cortical thickness) and regional reductions in frontal regions (medial OFC and superior frontal gyrus) and primary and higher-order visual, somatosensory and motor areas (d: -0.26 to -0.57). The strongest effects were found in recurrent adolescent patients. This highly powered global effort to identify consistent brain abnormalities showed widespread cortical alterations in MDD patients as compared to controls and suggests that MDD may impact brain structure in a highly dynamic way, with different patterns of alterations at different stages of life.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 3 May 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.60.},

	abstract = {Recent development of technologies has made it easy to obtain a large amount of multi-view biomedical data from different sources or different preprocessing methods, such as the genome-wide data or electroencephalography (EEG) data. Multi-view intact space learning (MISL), which integrates the complementary information from multiple views to discover a latent intact representation of the data, has shown to be effective in computer vision and data mining tasks. However, it fails in biomedical data analysis since it loses geometric information when projecting data from the original space to the intact space. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-view intact space learning with geodesic similarity preserving (MISL-GSP). The method first builds one KNN graph for each view and then constructs a geodesic distance matrix that provides a suitable and noise-free similarity for characterizing the intra-view proximity. Based on the geodesic distance matrix, the average similarity among all the views can be obtained, which is used in the manifold regularization term of the multi-view intact space learning for preserving the geodesic similarity. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including the clustering experiments on 5 cancer datasets from the cancer genome atlas and the classification experiments on 1 EEG dataset.},

	issn = {1053-8119},
	abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (∼0.5mm×0.5mm), thick slices (∼2.0mm), and a field of view tailored to imaging the hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper) has been advanced as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal morphometry. Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived from HF-MRI has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (∼1mm3) T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort of healthy controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While measurements obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those obtained from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect of greater atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated minimum sample size required for detecting a 25\% change in patients' atrophy rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with a statistical power beta=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample size was N=325. Using a dataset of test–retest scans, we show that the measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate that these results were not a confound of certain methodological choices made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making longitudinal measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest (ROI) around the HF to globally align serial images, followed by slice-by-slice deformable registration to measure local volume change. Additionally, we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements within hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences in atrophy rates were detected in several subfields.},

Clustering of single omic datasets has proven invaluable for biological and medical research. The decreasing cost and development of additional high throughput methods now enable measurement of multi-omic data. Clustering multi-omic data has the potential to reveal further systems-level insights, but raises computational and biological challenges. Here, we review algorithms for multi-omics clustering, and discuss key issues in applying these algorithms. Our review covers methods developed specifically for omic data as well as generic multi-view methods developed in the machine learning community for joint clustering of multiple data types. In addition, using cancer data from TCGA, we perform an extensive benchmark spanning ten different cancer types, providing the first systematic comparison of leading multi-omics and multi-view clustering algorithms. The results highlight key issues regarding the use of single- versus multi-omics, the choice of clustering strategy, the power of generic multi-view methods and the use of approximated p-values for gauging solution quality. Due to the growing use of multi-omics data, we expect these issues to be important for future progress in the field.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the longitudinal repeatability and accuracy of cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements by using pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeled (pCASL) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in typically developing children. Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval with HIPAA compliance and informed consent were obtained. Twenty-two children aged 7-17 years underwent repeated pCASL examinations 2-4 weeks apart with a 3-T MR imager, along with in vivo blood T1 and arterial transit time measurements. Phase-contrast (PC) MR imaging was performed as the reference standard for global blood flow volume. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV) were used to evaluate accuracy and repeatability. Results: The accuracy of pCASL against the reference standard of PC MR imaging increased on incorporating subjectwise in vivo blood T1 measurement (ICC: 0.32 vs 0.58). The ICC further increased to 0.65 by using a population-based model of blood T1. Additionally, CBF measurements with use of pCASL demonstrated a moderate to good level of longitudinal repeatability in whole brain (ICC = 0.61, wsCV = 15\%), in gray matter (ICC = 0.65, wsCV = 14\%), and across 16 brain regions (mean ICC = 0.55, wsCV = 17\%). The mean arterial transit time was 1538 msec ± 123 (standard deviation) in the pediatric cohort studied, which showed an increasing trend with age (P = .043). Conclusion: Incorporating developmental changes in blood T1 is important for improving the accuracy of pCASL CBF measurements in children and adolescents; the noninvasive nature, accuracy, and longitudinal repeatability should facilitate the use of pCASL perfusion MR imaging in neurodevelopmental studies. © RSNA, 2012.},

	abstract = {Background: Pancreatic cancer (PaC) remains extremely lethal worldwide even after resection. PaC resection rates are low, making prognostic studies in resected PaC difficult. This large international population-based study aimed at exploring factors associated with survival in patients with resected TNM stage I-II PaC receiving chemotherapy and at developing and internationally validating a survival-predicting model. Methods: Data of stage I-II PaC patients resected and receiving chemotherapy in 2003-2014 were obtained from the national cancer registries of Belgium, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Norway, and the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-18 Program. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to investigate the associations of patient and tumor characteristics with overall survival, and analysis was performed in each country respectively without pooling. Prognostic factors remaining after backward selection in SEER-18 were used to build a nomogram, which was subjected to bootstrap internal validation and external validation using the European datasets. Results: A total of 11,837 resected PaC patients were analyzed, with median survival time of 18-23 months and 3-year survival rates of 21-31\%. In the main analysis, patient age, tumor T stage, N stage, and differentiation were associated with survival across most countries, with country-specific association patterns and strengths. However, tumor location was mostly not significantly associated with survival. Resection margin, hospital type, tumor size, positive and harvested lymph node number, lymph node ratio, and comorbidity number were associated with survival in certain countries where the information was available. A median survival time- and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival probability-predictive nomogram incorporating the backward-selected variables in the main analysis was established. It fits each European national cohort similarly well. Calibration curves showed very good agreement between nomogram-prediction and actual observation. The concordance index of the nomogram (0.60) was significantly higher than that of the T and N stage-based model (0.56) for predicting survival. Conclusions: In these large international population-based cohorts, patients with resected PaC receiving chemotherapy have distinct characteristics independently associated with survival, with country-specific patterns and strengths. A robust benchmark population-based survival-predicting model is established and internationally validated. Like previous models predicting survival in resected PaC, our nomogram performs modestly.},

Cocaine exposure may compromise the developing brain through disruption of neural ontogeny in dopaminergic systems, effects secondary to fetal hypoxemia, or altered cerebrovascular reactivity. Cocaine exposure may also lead to neonatal lesions in the caudate. However, long-term or latent effects of intrauterine cocaine exposure are rarely found. We use T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to quantify caudate nucleus morphology in matched control and exposed groups. The literature suggests that in utero cocaine exposure consequences in adolescents may be subtle, or masked by other variables. Our comparison focuses on contrasting the control group with high-exposure subjects (mothers who reported 2 median of 117 days of cocaine use during pregnancy; 82\% tested positive for cocaine use at term). We use advanced image registration and segmentation tools to quantify left and right caudate morphology. Our results indicate that the caudate is significantly larger in controls versus subjects (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.0025), implying cocaine exposure-related detriments to the dopaminergic system.

	abstract = {In many multivariate statistical techniques, a set of linear functions of the original p variables is produced. One of the more difficult aspects of these techniques is the interpretation of the linear functions, as these functions usually have nonzero coefficients on all p variables. A common approach is to effectively ignore (treat as zero) any coefficients less than some threshold value, so that the function becomes simple and the interpretation becomes easier for the users. Such a procedure can be misleading. There are alternatives to principal component analysis which restrict the coefficients to a smaller number of possible values in the derivation of the linear functions, or replace the principal components by "principal variables." This article introduces a new technique, borrowing an idea proposed by Tibshirani in the context of multiple regression where similar problems arise in interpreting regression equations. This approach is the so-called LASSO, the "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator," in which a bound is introduced on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, and in which some coefficients consequently become zero. We explore some of the properties of the new technique, both theoretically and using simulation studies, and apply it to an example.},

Here a free-breathing myocardial ASL technique with the potential for reliable clinical application is presented, by combining ASL with a navigator-gated, electrocardiography-triggered TrueFISP readout sequence. Dynamic myocardial perfusion signals were measured at multiple delay times that allowed simultaneous fitting of myocardial blood flow and arterial transit time. With the assist of a nonrigid motion correction program, the estimated mean myocardial blood flow was 1.00 ± 0.55 mL/g/min with a mean transit time of ∼400 msec. The intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated scans was 0.89 with a mean within subject coefficient of variation of 22\%. Perfusion response during mild to moderate stress was further measured.

It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age' as a biomarker of an individual's brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age. Importantly, recent evidence shows that having an ‘older'-appearing brain relates to advanced physiological and cognitive ageing and the risk of mortality. We discuss controversies surrounding brain age and highlight emerging trends such as the use of multimodality neuroimaging and the employment of ‘deep learning' methods. Brain age can be predicted in individuals based on neuroimaging data using machine learning approaches to model trajectories of healthy brain ageing. The predicted brain age for a new individual can differ from his or her chronological age; this difference appears to reflect advanced or delayed brain ageing. Brain age has been shown to relate to cognitive ageing and multiple aspects of physiological ageing and to predict the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and mortality in older adults. Various diseases, including HIV, schizophrenia, and diabetes, have been shown to make the brain appear older. Further, brain age is being used to identify possible protective or deleterious factors for brain health as people age. Brain age is being actively developed to combine multiple measures of brain structure and function, capturing increasing amounts of detail on the ageing brain.},

	abstract = {A major goal in neuroscience is to understand the neural pathways underlying human behavior. We introduce the recently developed Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) method to the neuroscience community to simultaneously analyze imaging and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project. Motivated by recent computational and theoretical improvements in the JIVE approach, we simultaneously explore the joint and individual variation between and within imaging and behavioral data. In particular, we demonstrate that JIVE is an effective and efficient approach for integrating task fMRI and behavioral variables using three examples: one example where task variation is strong, one where task variation is weak and a reference case where the behavior is not directly related to the image. These examples are provided to visualize the different levels of signal found in the joint variation including working memory regions in the image data and accuracy and response time from the in-task behavioral variables. Joint analysis provides insights not available from conventional single block decomposition methods such as Singular Value Decomposition. Additionally, the joint variation estimated by JIVE appears to more clearly identify the working memory regions than Partial Least Squares (PLS), while Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) gives grossly overfit results. The individual variation in JIVE captures the behavior unrelated signals such as a background activation that is spatially homogeneous and activation in the default mode network. The information revealed by this individual variation is not examined in traditional methods such as CCA and PLS. We suggest that JIVE can be used as an alternative to PLS and CCA to improve estimation of the signal common to two or more datasets and reveal novel insights into the signal unique to each dataset.},

	title = {Profiling genome-wide {DNA} methylation},
	abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in regulating gene expression and therefore a broad range of biological processes and diseases. DNA methylation is tissue-specific, dynamic, sequence-context-dependent and trans-generationally heritable, and these complex patterns of methylation highlight the significance of profiling DNA methylation to answer biological questions. In this review, we surveyed major methylation assays, along with comparisons and biological examples, to provide an overview of DNA methylation profiling techniques. The advances in microarray and sequencing technologies make genome-wide profiling possible at a single-nucleotide or even a single-cell resolution. These profiling approaches vary in many aspects, such as DNA input, resolution, genomic region coverage, and bioinformatics analysis, and selecting a feasible method requires knowledge of these methods. We first introduce the biological background of DNA methylation and its pattern in plants, animals and fungi. We present an overview of major experimental approaches to profiling genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and then extend to the single-cell methylome. To evaluate these methods, we outline their strengths and weaknesses and perform comparisons across the different platforms. Due to the increasing need to compute high-throughput epigenomic data, we interrogate the computational pipeline for bisulfite sequencing data and also discuss the concept of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This review summarizes the experimental and computational concepts for profiling genome-wide DNA methylation, followed by biological examples. Overall, this review provides researchers useful guidance for the selection of a profiling method suited to specific research questions.},

	abstract = {Dementia is one of the most debilitating aspects of Parkinson's disease. There are no validated biomarkers that can track Parkinson's disease progression, nor accurately identify patients who will develop dementia and when. Understanding the sequence of observable changes in Parkinson's disease in people at elevated risk for developing dementia could provide an integrated biomarker for identifying and managing individuals who will develop Parkinson's dementia. We aimed to estimate the sequence of clinical and neurodegeneration events, and variability in this sequence, using data-driven statistical modelling in two separate Parkinson's cohorts, focusing on patients at elevated risk for dementia due to their age at symptom onset. We updated a novel version of an event-based model that has only recently been extended to cope naturally with clinical data, enabling its application in Parkinson's disease for the first time. The observational cohorts included healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease, of whom those diagnosed at age 65 or older were classified as having high risk of dementia. The model estimates that Parkinson's progression in patients at elevated risk for dementia starts with classic prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (olfaction, sleep), followed by early deficits in visual cognition and increased brain iron content, followed later by a less certain ordering of neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra and cortex, neuropsychological cognitive deficits, retinal thinning in dopamine layers, and further deficits in visual cognition. Importantly, we also characterize variation in the sequence. We found consistent, cross-validated results within cohorts, and agreement between cohorts on the subset of features available in both cohorts. Our sequencing results add powerful support to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that visual processing specifically is affected early in patients with Parkinson's disease at elevated risk of dementia. This opens a route to earlier and more precise detection, as well as a more detailed understanding of the pathological mechanisms underpinning Parkinson's dementia.},

We first show that PCA can be formulated as a regression-type optimization problem; sparse loadings are then obtained by imposing the lasso (elastic net) constraint on the regression coefficients. Efficient algorithms are proposed to fit our SPCA models for both regular multivariate data and gene expression arrays. We also give a new formula to compute the total variance of modified principal components.

	abstract = {Copathologies play an important role in the expression of the AD clinical phenotype and may influence treatment efficacy. Early-onset AD (EOAD), defined as manifesting before age 65, is viewed as a relatively pure form of AD with a more homogeneous neuropathological substrate. We sought to compare the frequency of common neuropathological diagnoses in a consecutive autopsy series of 96 patients with EOAD (median age of onset = 55 years, 44 females) and 48 with late-onset AD (LOAD) (median age of onset = 73 years, 14 females). The UCSF Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank database was reviewed to identify patients with a primary pathological diagnosis of AD. Prevalence and stage of Lewy body disease (LBD), limbic age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and vascular brain injury (VBI) were compared between the two cohorts. We found at least one non-AD pathological diagnosis in 98\% of patients with EOAD (versus 100\% of LOAD), and the number of comorbid diagnoses per patient was lower in EOAD than in LOAD (median=2 versus 3, Mann-Whitney Z = 3.00, p = 0.002). LBD and CAA were common in both EOAD and LOAD (CAA: 86\% versus 79\%, Fisher exact p = 0.33; LBD: 49\% versus 42\%, p = 0.48, respectively), although amygdala-predominant LBD was more commonly found in EOAD than LOAD (22\% versus 6\%, p = 0.02). In contrast, LATE (35\% versus 8\%, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001), HS (15\% versus 3\%, p = 0.02), AGD (58\% versus 41\%, p = 0.052), and VBI (65\% versus 39\%, p = 0.004) were more common in LOAD than EOAD, respectively. The number of copathologies predicted worse cognitive performance at the time of death on MMSE (1.4 points/pathology (95\%CI [-2.5, -0.2]) and Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (1.15 point/pathology, 95\%CI [0.45, 1.84]), across the EOAD and the LOAD cohorts. The effect of sex on the number of copathologies was not significant (p = 0.17). Prevalence of at least one APOE ϵ4 allele was similar across the two cohorts (52\% and 54\%) and was associated with a greater number of copathologies (+0.40, 95\%CI [0.01, 0.79], p = 0.047), independent of age of symptom onset, sex, and disease duration. Females showed higher density of neurofibrillary tangles compared to men, controlling for age of onset, APOE ϵ4, and disease duration. Our findings suggest that non-AD pathological diagnoses play an important role in the clinical phenotype of EOAD with potentially significant implications for clinical practice and clinical trials design.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive dysfunction is well documented in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, association between regional brain volume change and cognitive decline of PD is uncertain. Purpose: To compare regional brain volume difference between PD without dementia (PDND) and PD with dementia (PDD). Material and Methods: We enrolled 16 normal controls (mean±SD: 69.5±6.31) and 32 sex-, age-matched patients with PD (16 PDND and 16 PDD patients with Hoehn \& Yahr stage II or III). Cognitive function was assessed using mini-mental status examination (MMSE). Intracranial volume (ICV) and the hippocampal volumes were manually measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Regional gray/white matter volume changes were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. Results: Age, ICV, volume of gray matter volume (GMV), white matter, and hippocampi did not differ among the three groups. The regional GMV of PDD was significantly decreased in the areas of right middle frontal gyrus, short insular gyri, superior temporal gyri; both precuneus compared to PDND (uncorrected P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). In the partial correlation analysis (controlled for age, sex, ICV), regional GMV of PD was positively correlated with MMSE score in the areas of short insular gyri, right circular insular sulcus, right calcarine sulcus, left superior temporal gyrus (planum porale), and left inferior precentral sulcus (uncorrected P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Conclusion: We suggest that the volume loss of hippocampus may not be a finding in developing of PDD while variation of the regional volume of the frontal, insular cortex, superior temporal gyri, and precuneus lobes may be a phenomenon of PDD.},

Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.},

We aim to bridge this gap by developing methods based on Angle-based Joint and Individual Variation Explained to compare and contrast data from histopathol- ogy and genetics. Quantitative analysis of histopathology data re- quires statistical analysis of images and presents a variety of chal- lenges including feature extraction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven adept at solving predictive tasks with images and are believed to be powerful, automatic feature extraction algo- rithms. Leveraging deep learning for exploratory/inferential analysis, where the goal is for humans to learn about patterns in the data, is challenging because deciphering signals captured by deep learning algorithms is a notoriously difficult problem. We therefore develop methods for interpreting visual signals discovered in the data when doing exploratory analysis using CNNs for image feature extraction.

	abstract = {Label fusion strategies are used in multi-atlas image segmentation approaches to compute a consensus segmentation of an image, given a set of candidate segmentations produced by registering the image to a set of atlases [19, 11, 8]. Effective label fusion strategies, such as local similarity-weighted voting [1, 13] substantially reduce segmentation errors compared to single-atlas segmentation. This paper extends the label fusion idea to the problem of finding correspondences across a set of images. Instead of computing a consensus segmentation, weighted voting is used to estimate a consensus coordinate map between a target image and a reference space. Two variants of the problem are considered: (1) where correspondences between a set of atlases are known and are propagated to the target image; (2) where correspondences are estimated across a set of images without prior knowledge. Evaluation in synthetic data shows that correspondences recovered by fusion methods are more accurate than those based on registration to a population template. In a 2D example in real MRI data, fusion methods result in more consistent mappings between manual segmentations of the hippocampus. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Despite a significant growth in the last few years, the availability of 3D content is still dwarfed by that of its 2D counterpart. To close this gap, many 2D-to-3D image and video conversion methods have been proposed. Methods involving human operators have been most successful but also time-consuming and costly. Automatic methods, which typically make use of a deterministic 3D scene model, have not yet achieved the same level of quality for they rely on assumptions that are often violated in practice. In this paper, we propose a new class of methods that are based on the radically different approach of learning the 2D-to-3D conversion from examples. We develop two types of methods. The first is based on learning a point mapping from local image/video attributes, such as color, spatial position, and, in the case of video, motion at each pixel, to scene-depth at that pixel using a regression type idea. The second method is based on globally estimating the entire depth map of a query image directly from a repository of 3D images (image+depth pairs or stereopairs) using a nearest-neighbor regression type idea. We demonstrate both the efficacy and the computational efficiency of our methods on numerous 2D images and discuss their drawbacks and benefits. Although far from perfect, our results demonstrate that repositories of 3D content can be used for effective 2D-to-3D image conversion. An extension to video is immediate by enforcing temporal continuity of computed depth maps. © 1992-2012 IEEE.},

A synthetic average image is derived from the MRI of the samples using shape and intensity averaging in the diffeomorphic non-linear registration framework, and a consensus labeling of the template is generated. The agreement of the consensus labeling with manual labeling of each sample is measured, and the effect of aiding registration with landmarks and manually generated mask images is evaluated.

	abstract = {The Advanced Normalizations Tools ecosystem, known as ANTsX, consists of multiple open- source software libraries which house top-performing algorithms used worldwide by scientific and research communities for processing and analyzing biological and medical imaging data. The base software library, ANTs, is built upon, and contributes to, the NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit. Founded in 2008 with the highly regarded Symmetric Normalization image registration framework, the ANTs library has since grown to include additional functionality. Recent enhancements include statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network architectures and trained models for specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI. Not only does this significantly improve computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over the existing ANTs pipeline but it also illustrates the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework for medical image analysis. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement No external funding was received. \#\#\# Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

	abstract = {Human brain atlases are essential for research and surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). For example, deep brain stimulation for PD often requires human brain atlases for brain structure identification. However, few atlases can provide disease-specific subcortical structures for PD, and most of them are based on T1w and T2w images. In this work, we construct a HybraPD atlas using fused quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and T1w images from 87 patients with PD. The constructed HybraPD atlas provides a series of templates, that is, T1w, GRE magnitude, QSM, R2*, and brain tissue probabilistic maps. Then, we manually delineate a parcellation map with 12 bilateral subcortical nuclei, which are highly related to PD pathology, such as sub-regions in globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Furthermore, we build a whole-brain parcellation map by combining existing cortical parcellation and white-matter segmentation with the proposed subcortical nuclei map. Considering the multimodality of the HybraPD atlas, the segmentation accuracy of each nucleus is evaluated using T1w and QSM templates, respectively. The results show that the HybraPD atlas provides more accurate segmentation than existing atlases. Moreover, we analyze the metabolic difference in subcortical nuclei between PD patients and healthy control subjects by applying the HybraPD atlas to calculate uptake values of contrast agents on positron emission tomography (PET) images. The atlas-based analysis generates accurate disease-related brain nuclei segmentation on PET images. The newly developed HybraPD atlas could serve as an efficient template to study brain pathological alterations in subcortical regions for PD research.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source ANTsRNet—a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here. Materials and Methods: Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively. Results: Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 ± 0.03, right lung: 0.94 ± 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 ± 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 ± 0.02, right lung: 0.96 ± 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 ± 0.01), processing time is {\textbackslash}textless1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers. Conclusion: The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Current analytical techniques applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data require a priori knowledge or specific assumptions about the time courses of processes contributing to the measured signals. Here we describe a new method for analyzing fMRI data based on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129-1159). We decomposed eight fMRI data sets from 4 normal subjects performing Stroop color-naming, the Brown and Peterson work/number task, and control tasks into spatially independent components. Each component consisted of voxel values at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component "map"), and a unique associated time course of activation. Given data from 144 time points collected during a 6-min trial, ICA extracted an equal number of spatially independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived one and only one component with a time course closely matching the time course of 40-sec alternations between experimental and control tasks. The regions of maximum activity in these consistently task-related components generally overlapped active regions detected by standard correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not detected by correlation. Time courses of other ICA components were transiently task-related, quasiperiodic, or slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order statistics to enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm and a related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon [1994]: Signal Processing 36:11-20) were superior to principal component analysis (PCA) in determining the spatial and temporal extent of task-related activation. For each subject, the time courses and active regions of the task-related ICA components were consistent across trials and were robust to the addition of simulated noise. Simulated movement artifact and simulated task-related activations added to actual fMRI data were clearly separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to distinguish between nontask-related signal components, movements, and other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently task-related fMRI activations, based on only weak assumptions about their spatial distributions and without a priori assumptions about their time courses. ICA appears to be a highly promising method for the analysis of fMRI data from normal and clinical populations, especially for uncovering unpredictable transient patterns of brain activity associated with performance of psychomotor tasks.},

However, there are various methodological issues inherent to longitudinal morphometry in TBI that researchers need to be aware of. In this paper, we first overview several of these methodological challenges: lesion evolution, neurosurgical procedures, power, bias, and nonlinearity.

	abstract = {Peer-reviewed publications are the primary mechanism for sharing scientific results. The current peer-review process is, however, fraught with many problems that undermine the pace, validity, and credibility of science. We highlight five salient problems: (1) reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise; (2) reviewers do not have sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study; (3) reviewers are neither identified nor acknowledged; (4) there is no measure of the quality of a review; and (5) reviews take a lot of time, and once submitted cannot evolve. We propose that these problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process. Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer's specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer. Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive evaluation would facilitate transparency, greater scrutiny, and replication of results. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively assess reviewer contributions, which could be used to establish the impact of the reviewer in the scientific community. Quantifying review quality could help establish the importance of individual reviews and reviewers as well as the submitted article. Finally, we recommend expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialogue to continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner. We argue that these solutions can be implemented by adapting existing features from open-source software management and social networking technologies. We propose a model of an open, interactive review system that quantifies the significance of articles, the quality of reviews and the reputation of reviewers. © 2012 Ghosh, Klein, Avants and Millman.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces. Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces. Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic analysis was performed on three volunteers. RESULTS: Tag lines in inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous 3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior. CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged (3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (∼0.5mm×0.5mm), thick slices (∼2.0mm), and a field of view tailored to imaging the hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper) has been advanced as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal morphometry. Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived from HF-MRI has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (∼1mm 3) T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort of healthy controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While measurements obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those obtained from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect of greater atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated minimum sample size required for detecting a 25\% change in patients' atrophy rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with a statistical power beta=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample size was N=325. Using a dataset of test-retest scans, we show that the measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate that these results were not a confound of certain methodological choices made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making longitudinal measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest (ROI) around the HF to globally align serial images, followed by slice-by-slice deformable registration to measure local volume change. Additionally, we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements within hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences in atrophy rates were detected in several subfields. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, this task is complicated by the lack of prior knowledge concerning tumor location, spatial extent, shape, possible displacement of normal tissue, and intensity signature. To accommodate such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed ANTsR package–a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing entry in the MICCAI 2013 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge.

In chemometrics, sequential multiblock methods are popular; that is, methods that calculate one component at a time and use deflation for finding the next component. In this paper a framework is provided for sequential multiblock methods, including hierarchical PCA (HPCA; two versions), consensus PCA (CPCA; two versions) and generalized PCA (GPCA). Properties of the methods are derived and characteristics of the methods are discussed. All this is illustrated with a real five-block example from chromatography. The only methods with clear optimization criteria are GPCA and one version of CPCA. Of these, GPCA is shown to give inferior results compared with CPCA. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the spread of tau pathology throughout the cerebral cortex. This spreading pattern was thought to be fairly consistent across individuals, although recent work has demonstrated substantial variability in the population with AD. Using tau-positron emission tomography scans from 1,612 individuals, we identified 4 distinct spatiotemporal trajectories of tau pathology, ranging in prevalence from 18 to 33\%. We replicated previously described limbic-predominant and medial temporal lobe-sparing patterns, while also discovering posterior and lateral temporal patterns resembling atypical clinical variants of AD. These ‘subtypes' were stable during longitudinal follow-up and were replicated in a separate sample using a different radiotracer. The subtypes presented with distinct demographic and cognitive profiles and differing longitudinal outcomes. Additionally, network diffusion models implied that pathology originates and spreads through distinct corticolimbic networks in the different subtypes. Together, our results suggest that variation in tau pathology is common and systematic, perhaps warranting a re-examination of the notion of ‘typical AD' and a revisiting of tau pathological staging.},

There has been little to no work examining the reproducibility of network metrics derived from different types of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (e.g.; resting vs. task related, or pulse sequences other than standard blood oxygen level dependent [BOLD] data) or of measures of network structure at levels other than summary statistics. Here, we take up these questions, comparing the reproducibility of graphs derived from resting arterial spin-labeling perfusion fMRI with those derived from BOLD scans collected while the participant was performing a task. We also examine the reproducibility of the anatomical connectivity implied by the graph by investigating test-retest consistency of the graphs' edges. We compare two measures of graph-edge consistency both within versus between subjects and across data types. We find a dissociation in the reproducibility of network metrics, with metrics from resting data most reproducible at lower frequencies and metrics from task-related data most reproducible at higher frequencies; that same dissociation is not recapitulated, however, in network structure, for which the task-related data are most consistent at all frequencies. Implications for the practice of network analysis are discussed. © 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

The framework requires standard spatial reference systems (principally Waxholm Space, WHS) and a supporting data sharing infrastructure (Digital Atlasing Infrastructure, DAI); each of which is the main focus of an Atlasing Task Force. User data are primarily shared through atlas hubs, specialized servers available as part of the infrastructure or that may be installed and managed locally. Hubs register users' data to a spatial reference system, publish the data and services with INCF Central and share data via web services. At this time, the focus of both groups is on integrating image registration workflows to the underlying infrastructure with the aid of metadata, provenance, and ontology standards. Data sharing use cases drive our workflow development. At this time, we are focusing on 2D brain slice images (sampling varies from sparse to densely sampled). The goal is to create tools, recommendations, and standard operating procedures to aid in the registration of data to a known standard atlas space and creation of new atlas hubs. With workflows that allow the creation of atlas hubs, new datasets will be able to be queried and compared to data in other atlas hubs, such as EMAGE and Allen Brain Atlas. The two task forces are working on multiple related project areas, including: •Production of registration fiducials and landmarks •Standards for registration transformations •Data management and handling •Metadata •Provenance •Atlas hub in a Box •WHS for the rat •PONS pan mammalian delineations of WHS dataset These areas are either needed to integrate other components with the INCF DAI, or are integrated with the infrastructure as they are developed.

	abstract = {Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) is a generalization of regularized canonical correlation analysis to 3 or more sets of variables. RGCCA is a component-based approach which aims to study the relationships between several sets of variables. The quality and interpretability of the RGCCA components are likely to be affected by the usefulness and relevance of the variables in each block. Therefore, it is an important issue to identify within each block which subsets of significant variables are active in the relationships between blocks. In this paper, RGCCA is extended to address the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) is proposed to combine RGCCA with an \vphantom{\{}\}{\textbackslash}backslashell 1\vphantom{\{}\}-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes SGCCA a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and usefulness of SGCCA are illustrated on a simulated dataset and on a 3-block dataset which combine gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization, and a qualitative phenotype measured on a set of 53 children with glioma. SGCCA is available on CRAN as part of the RGCCA package. © 2014 The Author.},

The reduction of the CT radiation dose, however, compromises the signal-to-noise ratio, which affects image quality and diagnostic performance. Recently, deep-learning-based algorithms have achieved promising results in LDCT denoising, especially convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures. This paper introduces a conveying path-based convolutional encoder-decoder (CPCE) network in 2-D and 3-D configurations within the GAN framework for LDCT denoising. A novel feature of this approach is that an initial 3-D CPCE denoising model can be directly obtained by extending a trained 2-D CNN, which is then fine-tuned to incorporate 3-D spatial information from adjacent slices. Based on the transfer learning from 2-D to 3-D, the 3-D network converges faster and achieves a better denoising performance when compared with a training from scratch. By comparing the CPCE network with recently published work based on the simulated Mayo data set and the real MGH data set, we demonstrate that the 3-D CPCE denoising model has a better performance in that it suppresses image noise and preserves subtle structures.},

	issn = {0897-7151},
	abstract = {Introduction Breachers are military and law enforcement personnel who use explosives during operations. Concern exists that traumatic brain injury (TBI) may result from repetitive blast exposures during breaching maneuvers. The current investigation explores this question by comparing neuroimaging findings across distinct groups with varying levels of breacher experience. Methods Personnel participating in breacher-related activities were assessed and grouped based upon previous length of service. DTI and 3D-T1 weighted sequences were acquired for white matter and gray matter analyses. Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) was used for subject processing. DTI reconstructions were performed using CAMINO. A population-specific shape/intensity template was generated from T1 images and used for DTI processing. White matter labels were provided by the JHU tractography atlas. Cortical thickness maps were generated using ANTs pipeline including N4 bias correction, registration-based brain extraction, 3- tissue segmentation using Atropos, and estimation of cortical thickness using DiReCT. NIREP data were used to estimate cortical labels. Consensus label estimation was generated using STAPLE. ROI-based regression analysis was employed using ANTsR-a data analysis interface between the statistical project R and ANTs. Student ttests were performed between groups using multiple testing FDR correction. Similar analyses were carried out for cortical thickness maps. Results Three groups were assessed. These included: (i) personnel attending a breacher training course (BTS, N= 19) based in Quantico, VA, (ii) instructors of that course with 1-3 years of experience (BI, N= 4), and (iii) instructors with 7-15 years of experience (EBI, N= 4). Neither the BTS nor the BI groups contained individuals with histories suggestive of prior TBI. In the EBI group, 3 of 4 subjects endorsed a history of mild TBI. Comparisons included: (i) BTS vs. BI, (ii) BTS vs. EBI, and (iii) BI vs. EBI. No significant differences were seen with cortical thickness or DTI assessments in the BTS vs. BI or the BI vs. EBI comparisons. Multiple statistically significant differences were seen in the BTS vs. EBI comparison. Some of these included: significant differences in mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) in the bilateral superior cerebellar peduncles and right posterior limb of the internal capsule. Changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), MD, and RD were also seen in the left cingulum. Alterations in MD and RD were noted in right superior corona radiata and corticospinal tract. Additionally, changes in cortical thickness were seen in the BTS vs. EBI comparison in the right precentral gyrus, left temporal pole, and left middle frontal region. Conclusions Personnel trained to perform breaching maneuvers may be exposed to hundreds of blast events during their career. The current study explores neuroimaging correlates in three groups of breachers with varying levels of experience. Statistically significant differences were seen in breachers with 7-15 years of experience when compared with personnel attending a breacher training course. No such differences were seen when comparing these groups to instructors with 1-3 years experience. These findings may represent a cumulative effect of repetitive blast exposure. Findings may also reflect changes associated with known mild TBI in three of four individuals in the experienced group. Ongoing studies will continue to assess whether cumulative changes are seen in the brains of individuals with occupational repetitive low level blast exposure.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (ERC) and the perirhinal cortex (PRC) are subregions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that play important roles in episodic memory representations, as well as serving as a conduit between other neocortical areas and the hippocampus. They are also the sites where neuronal damage first occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability to automatically quantify the volume and thickness of the ERC and PRC is desirable because these localized measures can potentially serve as better imaging biomarkers for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, large anatomical variation in the PRC makes it a challenging area for analysis. In order to address this problem, we propose an automatic segmentation, clustering, and thickness measurement approach that explicitly accounts for anatomical variation. The approach is targeted to highly anisotropic (0.4×0.4×2.0mm3) T2-weighted MRI scans that are preferred by many authors for detailed imaging of the MTL, but which pose challenges for segmentation and shape analysis. After automatically labeling MTL substructures using multi-atlas segmentation, our method clusters subjects into groups based on the shape of the PRC, constructs unbiased population templates for each group, and uses the smooth surface representations obtained during template construction to extract regional thickness measurements in the space of each subject. The proposed thickness measures are evaluated in the context of discrimination between patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and normal controls (NC). © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

By contrast, the level of expression of both DAT mRNA and VMAT2 mRNA was markedly reduced in Parkinson's disease; these reductions in hybridisation signal were associated with (i) a marked loss of dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra, and (ii) a reduction in both DAT and VMAT2 signal per cell in the remaining pigmented neurones. These disease-related decreases in the cellular abundance of both DAT and VMAT2 gene transcripts in the surviving cells of the parkinsonian nigra may reflect compensatory changes in catecholamine signalling or may be a consequence of neuronal dysfunction.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of various image-based metrics computed from thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) with data from pulmonary function testing (PFT) in characterizing interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with ILD and 11 with COPD had undergone both PFT and HRCT within 3 days. For each patient, 93 image-based metrics were computed, and their relationships with the 21 clinically used PFT parameters were analyzed using a minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance statistical framework. The first 20 features were selected among the total of 114 mixed image metrics and PFT values in the characterization of ILD and COPD. RESULTS: Among the best-performing 20 features, 14 were image metrics, derived from attenuation histograms and texture descriptions. The highest relevance value computed from PFT parameters was 0.47, and the highest from image metrics was 0.52, given the theoretical bound as [0, 0.69]. The ILD or COPD classifier using the first four features achieved a 1.92\% error rate. CONCLUSIONS: Some image metrics are not only as good discriminators as PFT for the characterization of ILD and COPD but are also not redundant when PFT values are provided. Image metrics of attenuation histogram statistics and texture descriptions may be valuable for further investigation in computer-assisted diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To adapt the so-called nonlocal means filter to deal with magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially varying noise levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise). Materials and Methods: Most filtering techniques assume an equal noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This is the case of MR images with spatially varying noise levels, such as those obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of denoising strength of the filter. Such information is automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise estimation method. Results: The proposed method was validated and compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases. Conclusion: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to outperform the standard filter when spatially varying noise is present in the images. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Registration of diverse sources of brain atlas data to standard coordinate spaces, managing coordinate transformations between reference spaces, and assessing the degree of certainty of spatial location descriptions and coordinate transformations, are the key issues in enabling atlas data integration based on spatial location in the brain. The problem is complex, because: a) different atlases and image stacks present different reference models of rodent brain; b) different image modalities result in different delineations of features and functional areas; c) there are a number of coordinate systems developed for the brain, each with different spatial properties and associated error models; d) coordinate transformations computed between 2D and 3D brain atlases have different error models, with degrees of distortion depending on the transformation technique; and e) the "true" deformation is usually unknown. This issue becomes more challenging as we move to atlas data integration across species, where transformations based on brain coordinates are likely to be meaningless. To address this problem, the INCF Program on digital brain atlasing has developed a common reference space for mouse brain (Waxholm Space, or WHS), and a collection of atlas services, which support on-demand coordinate system description, coordinate transformations, and a range of requests based on point-of-interest queries. The atlas services have been deployed at several atlas hubs, initially supporting coordinate translation between WHS, reference plates and volume representations of the Allen Mouse Brain atlas, and the Paxinos-Watson atlas of the mouse brain. In addition, a mechanism has been developed to register additional image collections to the system of atlas hubs within INCF Digital Atlasing Infrastructure (INCF-DAI) and derive additional spatial reference system descriptions and transformations. This poster focuses on two extensions of the INCF-DAI work: (a) standardization of online spatial registration workflows and (b) addition of coordinate transformation and registration accuracy measures to atlas services. We demonstrate registration workflow steps, show derivation of certainty fields for transformations between known coordinate systems, and present methodology for reporting transformation accuracy derived over the course of spatial registration.

MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress.

We aimed to identify features associated with AAO in PD by applying the objective-specific neuroimaging genetics approach and constructing an AAO prediction model. Our objective-specific neuroimaging genetics extended the sparse canonical correlation analysis by an additional data type related to the target task to investigate possible associations of the imaging–genetic, genetic–target, and imaging–target pairs simultaneously. The identified imaging, genetic, and combined features were used to construct analytical models to predict the AAO in a nested five-fold cross-validation. We compared our approach with those from two feature selection approaches where only associations of imaging–target and genetic–target were explored. Using only imaging features, AAO prediction was accurate in all methods. Using only genetic features, the results from other methods were worse or unstable compared to our model. Using both imaging and genetic features, our proposed model predicted the AAO well (r = 0.5486). Our findings could have significant impacts on the characterization of prodromal PD and contribute to diagnosing PD early because genetic features could be measured accurately from birth.},

	abstract = {Rational The human perirhinal cortex (PRC) plays critical roles in episodic and semantic memory and visual perception. The PRC consists of Brodmann areas 35 and 36 (BA35, BA36). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), BA35 is the first cortical site affected by neurofibrillary tangle pathology, which is closely linked to neural injury in AD. Large anatomical variability, manifested in the form of different cortical folding and branching patterns, makes it difficult to segment the PRC in MRI scans. Pathology studies have found that in ∼97\% of specimens, the PRC falls into one of three discrete anatomical variants. However, current methods for PRC segmentation and morphometry in MRI are based on single-template approaches, which may not be able to accurately model these discrete variants Methods A multi-template analysis pipeline that explicitly accounts for anatomical variability is used to automatically label the PRC and measure its thickness in T2-weighted MRI scans. The pipeline uses multi-atlas segmentation to automatically label medial temporal lobe cortices including entorhinal cortex, PRC and the parahippocampal cortex. Pairwise registration between label maps and clustering based on residual dissimilarity after registration are used to construct separate templates for the anatomical variants of the PRC. An optimal path of deformations linking these templates is used to establish correspondences between all the subjects. Experimental evaluation focuses on the ability of single-template and multi-template analyses to detect differences in the thickness of medial temporal lobe cortices between patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n=41) and age-matched controls (n=44). Results The proposed technique is able to generate templates that recover the three dominant discrete variants of PRC and establish more meaningful correspondences between subjects than a single-template approach. The largest reduction in thickness associated with aMCI, in absolute terms, was found in left BA35 using both regional and summary thickness measures. Further, statistical maps of regional thickness difference between aMCI and controls revealed different patterns for the three anatomical variants.},

	abstract = {A situation where J blocks of variables X 1, {\textbackslash}ldots, X J are observed on the same set of individuals is considered in this paper. A factor analysis approach is applied to blocks instead of variables. The latent variables (LV's) of each block should well explain their own block and at the same time the latent variables of same order should be as highly correlated as possible (positively or in absolute value). Two path models can be used in order to obtain the first order latent variables. The first one is related to confirmatory factor analysis: each LV related to one block is connected to all the LV's related to the other blocks. Then, PLS path modeling is used with mode A and centroid scheme. Use of mode B with centroid and factorial schemes is also discussed. The second model is related to hierarchical factor analysis. A causal model is built by relating the LV's of each block X j to the LV of the super-block X J + 1 obtained by concatenation of X 1, {\textbackslash}ldots, X J . Using PLS estimation of this model with mode A and path-weighting scheme gives an adequate solution for finding the first order latent variables. The use of mode B with centroid and factorial schemes is also discussed. The higher order latent variables are found by using the same algorithms on the deflated blocks. The first approach is compared with the MAXDIFF/MAXBET Van de Geer's algorithm (1984) and the second one with the ACOM algorithm (Chessel and Hanafi, 1996).

We use RIPMMARC to improve the interpretation of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion images by removing the component of perfusion that is predicted by the underlying anatomy. Using patch-based, rotation invariant descriptors derived from the anatomical image, we learn a predictive relationship between local neuroanatomical structure and the corresponding perfusion image. This relation allows us to produce an image of perfusion that would be predicted given only the underlying anatomy and a residual image that represents perfusion information that cannot be predicted by anatomical features. Our learned structural features are significantly better at predicting brain perfusion than tissue probability maps, which are the input to standard partial volume correction techniques. Studies in test-retest data show that both the anatomically predicted and residual perfusion signals are highly replicable for a given subject. In a pediatric population, both the raw perfusion and structurally predicted images are tightly linked to age throughout adolescence throughout the brain. Interestingly, the residual perfusion also shows a strong correlation with age in selected regions including the hippocampi (corr=0.38, p-value {\textbackslash}textless10-6), precuneus (corr=-0.44, p{\textbackslash}textless10-5), and combined default mode network regions (corr=-0.45, p{\textbackslash}textless10-8) that is independent of global anatomy-perfusion trends.

	abstract = {This review summarizes the last decade of work by the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) Consortium, a global alliance of over 1400 scientists across 43 countries, studying the human brain in health and disease. Building on large-scale genetic studies that discovered the first robustly replicated genetic loci associated with brain metrics, ENIGMA has diversified into over 50 working groups (WGs), pooling worldwide data and expertise to answer fundamental questions in neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology, and genetics. Most ENIGMA WGs focus on specific psychiatric and neurological conditions, other WGs study normal variation due to sex and gender differences, or development and aging; still other WGs develop methodological pipelines and tools to facilitate harmonized analyses of “big data” (i.e., genetic and epigenetic data, multimodal MRI, and electroencephalography data). These international efforts have yielded the largest neuroimaging studies to date in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. More recent ENIGMA WGs have formed to study anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts and behavior, sleep and insomnia, eating disorders, irritability, brain injury, antisocial personality and conduct disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. Here, we summarize the first decade of ENIGMA's activities and ongoing projects, and describe the successes and challenges encountered along the way. We highlight the advantages of collaborative large-scale coordinated data analyses for testing reproducibility and robustness of findings, offering the opportunity to identify brain systems involved in clinical syndromes across diverse samples and associated genetic, environmental, demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors.},

Both the image and 27 spirometric features were ranked based on their ability to characterize clinical diagnosis using a mutual information-based feature subset selection algorithm. It was found that the top image features perform much better compared with the current clinical gold-standard spirometric values when considered individually. Interestingly, it was also found that spirometric values are relatively orthogonal to these image feature values in terms of informational content.},

Patients (N = 62, [43 Abeta-positive]) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were divided into Abeta-positive and Abeta-negative groups via prespecified cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 or 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography standardized uptake value ratio cutoffs measured at baseline. We analyzed interaction of biomarker-confirmed Abeta status with SBA-rr change over a 2-year period using mixed-effects modeling. SBA-rr differences between Abeta-positive and Abeta-negative subjects increased significantly over time within subsystems of the default and visual networks. Changes exhibit an interaction with memory performance over time but were independent of glucose metabolism. Results reinforce the value of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating Alzheimer”s disease progression and suggest spontaneous neuronal activity changes are concomitant with cognitive decline.},

	issn = {10538119},
	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.006},
	abstract = {We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative to manual segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis that a large fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject, and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method. The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl et al., 2002); hippocampus segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion (Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction using BET (Smith, 2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al., 2001). The wrapper method generates 72\%, 14\%, 29\% and 21\% fewer erroneously segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion as the host method, the average Dice overlap between reference segmentations and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction, white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Psychometric tests predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because the definition of clinical AD relies on those same psychometric tests, the ability of these tests to identify underlying AD pathology remains unclear. Objective: To determine the degree to which psychometric testing predicts molecular evidence of AD amyloid pathology, as indicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-42, in patients with MCI, as compared to neuroimaging biomarkers. Methods: We identified 408 MCI subjects with CSF Abeta levels, psychometric test data, FDG-PET scans, and acceptable volumetric MR scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used psychometric tests and imaging biomarkers in univariate and multivariate models to predict Abeta status. Results: The 30-min delayed recall score of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was the best predictor of Abeta status among the psychometric tests, achieving an AUC of 0.67±0.02 and odds ratio of 2.5±0.4. FDG-PET was the best imaging-based biomarker (AUC 0.67±0.03, OR 3.2±1.2), followed by hippocampal volume (AUC 0.64±0.02, OR 2.4±0.3). A multivariate analysis based on the psychometric tests improved on the univariate predictors, achieving anAUCof 0.68±0.03 (OR 3.38±1.2). Adding imaging biomarkers to the multivariate analysis did not improve the AUC. Conclusion: Psychometric tests perform as well as imaging biomarkers to predict presence of molecular markers ofADpathology in MCI patients and should be considered in the determination of the likelihood that MCI is due to AD.},

	abstract = {We develop a softassign method for application to curve matching. Softassign uses deterministic annealing to iteratively optimize the parameters of an energy function. It also incorporates outlier rejection by converting the energy into a stochastic matrix with entries for rejection probability. Previous applications of the method focused on finding transformations between unordered point sets. Thus, no topological constraints were required. In our application, we must consider the topology of the matching between the reference and the target curve. Our energy function also depends upon the rotation and scaling between the curves. Thus, we develop a topologically correct algorithm to update the are length correspondence, which is then used to update the similarity transformation. We further enhance robustness by using a scale-space description of the curves. This results in a curve-matching tool that, given an approximate initialization, is invariant to similarity transformations. We demonstrate the reliability of the technique by applying it to open and closed curves extracted from real patient images (cortical sulci in three dimensions and corpora callosa in two dimensions). The set of transformations is then used to compute anatomical atlases.},

	abstract = {We describe a recently recognized disease entity, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). LATE neuropathological change (LATE-NC) is defined by a stereotypical TDP-43 proteinopathy in older adults, with or without coexisting hippocampal sclerosis pathology. LATE-NC is a common TDP-43 proteinopathy, associated with an amnestic dementia syndrome that mimicked Alzheimer's-type dementia in retrospective autopsy studies. LATE is distinguished from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology based on its epidemiology (LATE generally affects older subjects), and relatively restricted neuroanatomical distribution of TDP-43 proteinopathy. In community-based autopsy cohorts, ∼25\% of brains had sufficient burden of LATE-NC to be associated with discernible cognitive impairment. Many subjects with LATE-NC have comorbid brain pathologies, often including amyloid-beta plaques and tauopathy. Given that the 'oldest-old' are at greatest risk for LATE-NC, and subjects of advanced age constitute a rapidly growing demographic group in many countries, LATE has an expanding but under-recognized impact on public health. For these reasons, a working group was convened to develop diagnostic criteria for LATE, aiming both to stimulate research and to promote awareness of this pathway to dementia. We report consensus-based recommendations including guidelines for diagnosis and staging of LATE-NC. For routine autopsy workup of LATE-NC, an anatomically-based preliminary staging scheme is proposed with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on tissue from three brain areas, reflecting a hierarchical pattern of brain involvement: amygdala, hippocampus, and middle frontal gyrus. LATE-NC appears to affect the medial temporal lobe structures preferentially, but other areas also are impacted. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that subjects with LATE-NC also had atrophy in the medial temporal lobes, frontal cortex, and other brain regions. Genetic studies have thus far indicated five genes with risk alleles for LATE-NC: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, KCNMB2, and APOE. The discovery of these genetic risk variants indicate that LATE shares pathogenetic mechanisms with both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, but also suggests disease-specific underlying mechanisms. Large gaps remain in our understanding of LATE. For advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, there is an urgent need for research focused on LATE, including in vitro and animal models. An obstacle to clinical progress is lack of diagnostic tools, such as biofluid or neuroimaging biomarkers, for ante-mortem detection of LATE. Development of a disease biomarker would augment observational studies seeking to further define the risk factors, natural history, and clinical features of LATE, as well as eventual subject recruitment for targeted therapies in clinical trials.},

The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression.

	abstract = {Recently two anomalous results in the literature have shown that certain feature learning architectures can yield useful features for object recognition tasks even with untrained, random weights. In this paper we pose the question: why do random weights sometimes do so well? Our answer is that certain convolutional pooling architectures can be inherently frequency selective and translation invariant, even with random weights. Based on this we demonstrate the viability of extremely fast architecture search by using random weights to evaluate candidate architectures, thereby sidestepping the time-consuming learning process. We then show that a surprising fraction of the performance of certain state-of-the-art methods can be attributed to the architecture alone. Copyright 2011 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

	abstract = {Survival analysis examines and models the time it takes for events to occur. The prototypical such event is death, from which the name survival analysis and much of its terminology derives, but the ambit of application of survival analysis is much broader. Essentially the same methods are employed in a variety of disciplines under various rubrics for example, event-history analysis in sociology. In this appendix, therefore, terms such as survival are to be understood generically. Survival analysis focuses on the distribution of survival times. Although there are well known methods for estimating unconditional survival distributions, most interesting survival modeling examines the relationship between survival and one or more predictors, usually termed covariates in the survival-analysis literature. The subject of this appendix is the Cox proportional-hazards regression model (introduced in a seminal paper by Cox, 1972), a broadly applicable and the most widely used method of survival analysis. Although I will not discuss them here, the survival library in R and S-PLUS also contains all of the other commonly employed tools of survival analysis.1 As is the case for the other appendices to An R and S-PLUS Companion to Applied Regression, I assume that you have read the main text and are therefore familiar with S. In addition, I assume familiarity with Cox regression. I nevertheless begin with a review of basic concepts, primarily to establish terminology and notation. The second section of the appendix takes up the Cox proportional-hazards model with timeindependent covariates. Time-dependent covariates are introduced in the third section. A fourth and final section deals with diagnostics. There are many texts on survival analysis: Cox and Oakes (1984) is a classic (if now slightly dated) source. Allison (1995) presents a highly readable introduction to the subject based on the SAS statistical package, but nevertheless of general interest. The major example in this appendix is adapted from Allison. A book by Therneau and Grambsch (2000) is also worthy of mention here because Therneau is the author of the survival library for S. Extensive documentation for the survival library may be found in Therneau (1999).},

	abstract = {We investigated the cognitive and neural bases of impaired speech fluency, a central feature of primary progressive aphasia. Speech fluency was assessed in 35 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) who presented with progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA, n = 11), semantic dementia (SemD, n = 12), or a social and executive disorder without aphasia (SOC/EXEC, n = 12). Fluency was quantified as the number of words per minute in an extended, semi-structured speech sample. This was related to language characteristics of the speech sample and to neuropsychological measures. PNFA patients were significantly less fluent than controls and other FTLD patients. Fluency correlated with grammatical expression but not with speech errors or executive difficulty. SemD and SOC/EXEC patients were also less fluent than controls. In SemD, fluency was associated with semantically limited content. In SOC/EXEC, fluency was associated with executive limitations. Voxel-based morphometry analyses of high-resolution MRI related fluency to gray matter volume in left inferior frontal, insula, and superior temporal regions for the entire cohort of FTLD patients. This region overlapped partially distinct atrophic areas in each FTLD subgroup. It thus appears to play a crucial role in speech fluency, which can be interrupted in different ways in different FTLD subgroups. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We describe our construction of probabilistic atlases that store detailed information on how the brain varies across age and gender, across time, in health and disease, and in large human populations. Specifically, we introduce a mathematical framework based on covariant partial differential equations (PDEs), pull-backs of mappings under harmonic flows, and high-dimensional random tensor fields to encode variations in cortical patterning, asymmetry and tissue distribution in a population-based brain image database (N =94 scans). We use this information to detect disease-specific abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, including dynamic changes over time. Illustrative examples are chosen to show how group patterns of cortical organization, asymmetry, and disease-specific trends can be resolved that are not apparent in individual brain images. Finally, we create four-dimensional (4D) maps that store probabilistic information on the dynamics of brain change in development and disease. Digital atlases that generate these maps show considerable promise in identifying general patterns of structural and functional variation in diseased populations, and revealing how these features depend on demographic, genetic, clinical and therapeutic parameters.},

	abstract = {Todos os campos da neurociência que empregam imagens cerebrais precisam comunicar seus resultados com referência às regiões anatômicas. Em particular, morfometria comparativae a análise de grupo de dados funcionais e fisiológicos requer o co-registro de cérebros para estabelecer correspondências entre as estruturas cerebrais. Está bem estabelecido que o registro linear de um cérebro para outro é inadequado para alinhar estruturas cerebrais, de modo que vários algoritmos surgiram para registrar cérebros de forma não linear entre si. Este estudo é a maior avaliação de algoritmos de deformação não linear aplicados ao registro de imagens cerebrais já realizada. Quatorze algoritmos de laboratórios em todo o mundo são avaliados usando 8 medidas de erro diferentes. Mais de 45.000 registros entre 80 cérebros marcados manualmente foram realizados por algoritmos, incluindo: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, fluido JRD, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, e quatro algoritmos SPM5 diferentes ("SPM2-type" e Normalização regular, Segmentação Unificada, e a caixa de ferramentas DAR℡). Todos esses registros foram precedidos por registro linear entre os mesmos pares de imagens usando o FLIRT. Uma das descobertas mais significativas deste estudo é que o desempenho relativo dos métodos de registro em comparação parece ser pouco afetado pela escolha da população de participantes, protocolo de rotulagem e tipo de medida de sobreposição. Isso é importante porque sugere que os resultados são generalizáveis ​​para novas populações de sujeitos que são rotulados ou avaliados usando diferentes protocolos de rotulagem. Além disso, classificamos os 14 métodos de acordo com três análises completamente independentes (testes de permutação, testes ANOVA de uma via e classificação da zona de indiferença) e derivamos três classificações superiores quase idênticas dos métodos. ART, SyN, IRTK e SPM ' s O DAR℡ Toolbox forneceu os melhores resultados de acordo com as medidas de sobreposição e distância, com ART e SyN fornecendo a mais alta precisão consistente em assuntos e conjuntos de etiquetas.

Here we present a canine brain atlas derived as the diffeomorphic average of a population of fifteen mesaticephalic dogs. The atlas includes: 1) A brain template derived from in-vivo, T1-weighted imaging at 1 mm isotropic resolution at 3 Tesla (with and without the soft tissues of the head); 2) A co-registered, high-resolution (0.33 mm isotropic) template created from imaging of ex-vivo brains at 7 Tesla; 3) A surface representation of the gray matter/white matter boundary of the high-resolution atlas (including labeling of gyral and sulcal features). The properties of the atlas are considered in relation to historical nomenclature and the evolutionary taxonomy of the Canini tribe.

	doi = {10.1142/9789811215636_0037},
	abstract = {The accurate prediction of a cancer patient's risk of progression or death can guide clinicians in the selection of treatment and help patients in planning personal affairs. Predictive models based on patient-level data represent a tool for determining risk. Ideally, predictive models will use multiple sources of data (e.g., clinical, demographic, molecular, etc.). However, there are many challenges associated with data integration, such as overfitting and redundant features. In this paper we aim to address those challenges through the development of a novel feature selection and feature reduction framework that can handle correlated data. Our method begins by computing a survival distance score for gene expression, which in combination with a score for clinical independence, results in the selection of highly predictive genes that are non-redundant with clinical features. The survival distance score is a measure of variation of gene expression over time, weighted by the variance of the gene expression over all patients. Selected genes, in combination with clinical data, are used to build a predictive model for survival. We benchmark our approach against commonly used methods, namely lasso-as well as ridge-penalized Cox proportional hazards models, using three publicly available cancer data sets: kidney cancer (521 samples), lung cancer (454 samples) and bladder cancer (335 samples). Across all data sets, our approach built on the training set outperformed the clinical data alone in the test set in terms of predictive power with a c.Index of 0.773 vs 0.755 for kidney cancer, 0.695 vs 0.664 for lung cancer and 0.648 vs 0.636 for bladder cancer. Further, we were able to show increased predictive performance of our method compared to lasso-penalized models fit to both gene expression and clinical data, which had a c.Index of 0.767, 0.677, and 0.645, as well as increased or comparable predictive power compared to ridge models, which had a c.Index of 0.773, 0.668 and 0.650 for the kidney, lung, and bladder cancer data sets, respectively. Therefore, our score for clinical independence improves prognostic performance as compared to modeling approaches that do not consider combining non-redundant data. Future work will concentrate on optimizing the survival distance score in order to achieve improved results for all types of cancer.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover the dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, PCA's interpretability remains limited. Indeed, the components produced by PCA are often noisy or exhibit no visually meaningful patterns. Furthermore, the fact that the components are usually non-sparse may also impede interpretation, unless arbitrary thresholding is applied. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as sparse PCA (SPCA), have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem in neuroimaging, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images that capture most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining, e.g., and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes information on the underlying structure of the data. This paper presents the structured SPCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate SPCA-TV's effectiveness and versatility on three different data sets. It can be applied to any kind of structured data, such as, e.g., -dimensional array images or meshes of cortical surfaces. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches (such as SPCA and ElasticNet PCA) or structured approach (such as GraphNet PCA) are significant, since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easier to interpret and more stable across different samples.},

	abstract = {Detecting outliers in a large set of data objects is a major data mining task aiming at finding different mechanisms responsible for different groups of objects in a data set. All existing approaches, however, are based on an assessment of distances (sometimes indirectly by assuming certain distributions) in the full-dimensional Euclidean data space. In high-dimensional data, these approaches are bound to deteriorate due to the notorious "curse of dimensionality". In this paper, we propose a novel approach named ABOD (Angle-Based Outlier Detection) and some variants assessing the variance in the angles between the difference vectors of a point to the other points. This way, the effects of the "curse of dimensionality" are alleviated compared to purely distance-based approaches. A main advantage of our new approach is that our method does not rely on any parameter selection influencing the quality of the achieved ranking. In a thorough experimental evaluation, we compare ABOD to the well-established distance-based method LOF for various artificial and a real world data set and show ABOD to perform especially well on high-dimensional data.

	abstract = {As our brains age, we tend to experience cognitive decline and are at greater risk of neurodegenerative disease and dementia. Symptoms of chronic neuropsychiatric diseases are also exacerbated during ageing. However, the ageing process does not affect people uniformly; nor, in fact, does the ageing process appear to be uniform even within an individual. Here, we outline recent neuroimaging research into brain ageing and the use of other bodily ageing biomarkers, including telomere length, the epigenetic clock, and grip strength. Some of these techniques, using statistical approaches, have the ability to predict chronological age in healthy people. Moreover, they are now being applied to neurological and psychiatric disease groups to provide insights into how these diseases interact with the ageing process and to deliver individualised predictions about future brain and body health. We discuss the importance of integrating different types of biological measurements, from both the brain and the rest of the body, to build more comprehensive models of the biological ageing process. Finally, we propose seven steps for the field of brain-ageing research to take in coming years. This will help us reach the long-term goal of developing clinically applicable statistical models of biological processes to measure, track and predict brain and body health in ageing and disease.},

	abstract = {Background: Brain structure abnormalities throughout the course of Parkinson's Disease (PD) have yet to be fully elucidated. Inconsistent findings across studies may be partly due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous analysis methods. Using a multicenter approach and harmonized analysis methods, we aimed to overcome these limitations and shed light on disease stage-specific profiles of PD pathology as suggested by in vivo neuroimaging. Method: Individual brain MRI and clinical data from 2,367 PD patients and 1,183 healthy controls were collected from 19 sites, deriving from 20 countries. We analyzed regional cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and subcortical volume using mixed-effect linear models. Patients were grouped according to the Hoehn \& Yahr (HY) disease stages and compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Within the PD sample, we investigated associations between Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and brain morphology. Findings: The main analysis showed a thinner cortex in 38 of 68 regions in PD patients compared to controls ( dmax = -0·25, dmin = -0·13). The bilateral putamen (left: d = -0·16, right: d = -0·16) and left amygdala ( d = -0·15) were smaller in patients, while the left thalamus was larger ( d = 0·17). HY staging indicated that a thinner cortex initially presents in the occipital, parietal and temporal cortex, and extends towards caudally located brain regions with increased disease severity. From HY stage 2 and onwards the bilateral putamen and amygdala were consistently smaller with larger effects denoting each increment. Finally, we found that poorer cognitive cognitive performance was associated with widespread cortical thinning as well as lower volumes of core limbic structures. Interpretation: Our findings offer robust and novel imaging signatures that are specific to the disease severity stages and in line with an ongoing neurodegenerative process, highlighting the importance of such multicenter collaborations.

	abstract = {For the last years, a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the research about the link prediction (LP) problem in complex networks. This problem tries to predict the likelihood of an association between two not interconnected nodes in a network to appear in the future. One of the most important approaches to the LP problem is based on supervised machine learning (ML) techniques for classification. Although many works have presented promising results with this approach, choosing the set of features (variables) to train the classifiers is still a major challenge. In this article, we report on the effects of three different automatic variable selection strategies (Forward, Backward and Evolutionary) applied to the feature-based supervised learning approach in LP applications. The results of the experiments show that the use of these strategies does lead to better classification models than classifiers built with the complete set of variables. Such experiments were performed over three datasets (Microsoft Academic Network, Amazon and Flickr) that contained more than twenty different features each, including topological and domain-specific ones. We also describe the specification and implementation of the process used to support the experiments. It combines the use of the feature selection strategies, six different classification algorithms (SVM, K-NN, naïve Bayes, CART, random forest and multilayer perceptron) and three evaluation metrics (Precision, F-Measure and Area Under the Curve). Moreover, this process includes a novel ML voting committee inspired approach that suggests sets of features to represent data in LP applications. It mines the log of the experiments in order to identify sets of features frequently selected to produce classification models with high performance. The experiments showed interesting correlations between frequently selected features and datasets.},

The decomposition consists of three terms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across data types, low-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each data type, and residual noise. JIVE quantifies the amount of joint variation between data types, reduces the dimensionality of the data and provides new directions for the visual exploration of joint and individual structures. The proposed method represents an extension of Principal Component Analysis and has clear advantages over popular two-block methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares.

The result is a method for designing variational energies that adjust the optimization process over the solution domain such that features which are salient in the human decision-making process are used. The application here is locating correspondence of corpora callosa that agree with expert user data. General principles that guide our particular application are first stated. These principles involve the definition of a generic variational problem and an associated optimization algorithm, given here for the case of matching curves. A small set of specific similarity criterion for curves is then defined. The ability of each feature to find correspondences that relate to human decisions is individually tested. Following the results of this study, a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) automatic landmarking and correspondence method is developed. The probabilities associated with the MAP estimates are also used to define variational weights that vary over the solution's domain.

	abstract = {Multiview data clustering attracts more attention than their single-view counterparts due to the fact that leveraging multiple independent and complementary information from multiview feature spaces outperforms the single one. Multiview spectral clustering aims at yielding the data partition agreement over their local manifold structures by seeking eigenvalue-eigenvector decompositions. Among all the methods, low-rank representation (LRR) is effective, by exploring the multiview consensus structures beyond the low rankness to boost the clustering performance. However, as we observed, such classical paradigm still suffers from the following stand-out limitations for multiview spectral clustering of overlooking the flexible local manifold structure, caused by aggressively enforcing the low-rank data correlation agreement among all views, and such a strategy, therefore, cannot achieve the satisfied between-views agreement; worse still, LRR is not intuitively flexible to capture the latent data clustering structures. In this paper, first, we present the structured LRR by factorizing into the latent low-dimensional data-cluster representations, which characterize the data clustering structure for each view. Upon such representation, second, the Laplacian regularizer is imposed to be capable of preserving the flexible local manifold structure for each view. Third, we present an iterative multiview agreement strategy by minimizing the divergence objective among all factorized latent data-cluster representations during each iteration of optimization process, where such latent representation from each view serves to regulate those from other views, and such an intuitive process iteratively coordinates all views to be agreeable. Fourth, we remark that such data-cluster representation can flexibly encode the data clustering structure from any view with an adaptive input cluster number. To this end, finally, a novel nonconvex objective function is proposed via the efficient alternating minimization strategy. The complexity analysis is also presented. The extensive experiments conducted against the real-world multiview data sets demonstrate the superiority over the state of the arts.},

	abstract = {The nature and frequency of speech production errors in neurodegenerative disease have not previously been precisely quantified. In the present study, 16 patients with a progressive form of non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) were asked to tell a story from a wordless children's picture book. Errors in production were classified as either phonemic, involving language-based deformations that nevertheless result in possible sequences of English speech segments; or phonetic, involving a motor planning deficit and resulting in non-English speech segments. The distribution of cortical atrophy as revealed by structural MRI scans was examined quantitatively in a subset of PNFA patients (N = 7). The few errors made by healthy seniors were only phonemic in type. PNFA patients made more than four times as many errors as controls. This included both phonemic and phonetic errors, with a preponderance of errors (82\%) classified as phonemic. The majority of phonemic errors were substitutions that shared most distinctive features with the target phoneme. The systematic nature of these substitutions is not consistent with a motor planning deficit. Cortical atrophy was found in prefrontal regions bilaterally and peri-Sylvian regions of the left hemisphere. We conclude that the speech errors produced by PNFA patients are mainly errors at the phonemic level of language processing and are not caused by a motor planning impairment. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Subtypes of AD, defined using an algorithm based on the relative number of tangle counts in these regions, have been proposed - hippocampal sparing (relative sparing of the hippocampus but high cortical load), limbic predominant (high hippocampal load but lower load in association cortices), and typical (balanced neurofibrillary tangles counts in the hippocampus and association cortices) AD - and shown to be associated with distinct antemortem clinical phenotypes. The ability to distinguish these AD subtypes from the more typical tau signature in vivo could have important implications for clinical research. Flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) images acquired from 45 amyloid-positive participants, defined clinically as mild cognitive impairment or AD, aged 50-92 years, 56\% female, and estimated to be Braak V-VI based on their PET pattern of tau pathology, were studied. By translating the neuropathologic algorithm to flortaucipir PET scans, patterns of tau pathology consistent with autopsy findings, and with a similar prevalence, were identified in vivo. 6/45 (13\%) participants were identified as hippocampal sparing and 6/45 (13\%) as limbic predominant AD subtypes. Hippocampal sparing participants were significantly younger than those assigned to the other two subtypes. Worse performance on delayed recall was associated with increased hippocampal tau signal, and worse performance on the trail making test B-A was associated with lower values of the hippocampus to cortex ratio. Prospective studies can further validate the flortaucipir SUVR cut-points and the phenotype of the corresponding AD subtypes.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	abstract = {A new approach is presented for elastic registration of medical images, and is applied to magnetic resonance images of the brain. Experimental results demonstrate very high accuracy in superposition of images from different subjects. There are two major novelties in the proposed algorithm. First, it uses an attribute vector, i.e., a set of geometric moment invariants (GMIs) that are defined on each voxel in an image and are calculated from the tissue maps, to reflect the underlying anatomy at different scales. The attribute vector, if rich enough, can distinguish between different parts of an image, which helps establish anatomical correspondences in the deformation procedure; it also helps reduce local minima, by reducing ambiguity in potential matches. This is a fundamental deviation of our method, referred to as the hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration (HAMMER), from other volumetric deformation methods, which are typically based on maximizing image similarity. Second, in order to avoid being trapped by local minima, i.e., suboptimal poor matches, HAMMER uses a successive approximation of the energy function being optimized by lower dimensional smooth energy functions, which are constructed to have significantly fewer local minima. This is achieved by hierarchically selecting the driving features that have distinct attribute vectors, thus, drastically reducing ambiguity in finding correspondence. A number of experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm results in accurate superposition of image data from individuals with significant anatomical differences.},

But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes are related to variable combinations of emphysema and small-airway disease, the latter manifested as air trapping (AT) on imaging. The investigators propose a method to extract AT information quantitatively from thoracic multi-detector row high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), validated by pulmonary function testing (PFT) correlation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent HRCT and PFT within a 3-day interval were retrospectively identified. Thin-section volumetric HRCT in inspiration and expiration was registered and analyzed using custom-made software. Nonaerated regions of lung were segmented through exclusion of voxels {\textbackslash}textgreater-50 Hounsfield units (HU); emphysematous areas were segmented as voxels {\textbackslash}textless-950 HU on inspiratory images. Small-airway AT volume (ATV) was segmented as regions of lung voxels whose attenuation values increased by less than a specified change threshold (set from 5 to 300 HU in 25-HU increments) between inspiration and expiration. Inspiratory and expiratory total segmented lung volumes, emphysema volume (EV), and ATV for each threshold were subsequently calculated and correlated with PFT parameters. RESULTS: A strong positive correlation was obtained between total segmented lung volume in inspiration and total lung capacity (r = 0.83). A strong negative correlation (r = -0.80) was obtained between EV and the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity. Stronger negative correlation with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -0.85) was demonstrated when ATV (threshold, 50 HU) was added to EV, indicating improved quantification of total AT to predict obstructive disease severity. A moderately strong positive correlation between ATV and residual volume was observed, with a maximum r value of 0.72 (threshold, 25 HU), greater than that between EV and residual volume (r = 0.58). The benefit of ATV quantification was greater in a subgroup of patients with negligible emphysema compared to patients with moderate to severe emphysema. CONCLUSIONS: Small-airway AT segmentation in conjunction with emphysema segmentation through computer-assisted methodologies may provide better correlations with key PFT parameters, suggesting that the quantification of emphysema-related and small airway-related components of AT from thoracic HRCT has great potential to elucidate phenotypic differences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ALS performed measures requiring word-description matching and associativity judgments with actions and objects. Voxel-based morphometry was used to relate these measures to cortical atrophy using high resolution structural MRI. RESULTS: Patients with ALS were significantly more impaired on measures requiring knowledge of actions than measures requiring knowledge of objects. Difficulty on measures requiring action knowledge correlated with cortical atrophy in motor cortex, implicating degraded knowledge of action features represented in motor cortex of patients with ALS. Performance on measures requiring object knowledge did not correlate with motor cortex atrophy. Several areas correlated with difficulty for both actions and objects, implicating these brain areas in components of semantic memory that are not dedicated to a specific category of knowledge. CONCLUSION: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are impaired on measures involving action knowledge, and this appears to be due to at least two sources of impairment: degradation of knowledge about action features represented in motor cortex and impairment on multicategory cognitive components contributing more generally to semantic memory.},

	abstract = {We extend a symmetric parametric curve matching algorithm designed for recognition and morphometry by incorporating Gaussian smoothing and curvature scale-space. A general statement of the matching theory and the properties of the associated algorithm is given. Gaussian smoothing is used to assist in approximating the continuous solution from the discrete solution given by dynamic programming. The method is then investigated in a multi-scale framework, which has the advantage of reducing the effects of noise and occlusion. A novel scale-space derived energy functional that incorporates geometric information from many scales at once is proposed. The related issue of selecting a smoothing kernel for a given matching problem is also explored, resulting in a topologically based method of scale-selection. This application requires estimating the matching between the fine and coarse scale versions of the same curve. We provide a tool for finding this inter-scale, intra-curve correspondence, based on tracking curvature extrema through scales. These novel algorithms are demonstrated on both 2D and 3D data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

	abstract = {To understand multifactorial conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) we need brain signatures that predict the impact of multiple pathologies and their interactions. To help uncover the relationships between pathology affected brain circuits and cognitive markers we have used mouse models that represent, at least in part, the complex interactions altered in AD, while being raised in uniform environments and with known genotype alterations. In particular, we aimed to understand the relationship between vulnerable brain circuits and memory deficits measured in the Morris water maze, and we tested several predictive modeling approaches. We used in vivo manganese enhanced MRI traditional voxel based analyses to reveal regional differences in volume (morphometry), signal intensity (activity), and magnetic susceptibility (iron deposition, demyelination). These regions included hippocampus, olfactory areas, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum, as well as the frontal association area. The properties of these regions, extracted from each of the imaging markers, were used to predict spatial memory. We next used eigenanatomy, which reduces dimensionality to produce sets of regions that explain the variance in the data. For each imaging marker, eigenanatomy revealed networks underpinning a range of cognitive functions including memory, motor function, and associative learning, allowing the detection of associations between context, location, and responses. Finally, the integration of multivariate markers in a supervised sparse canonical correlation approach outperformed single predictor models and had significant correlates to spatial memory. Among a priori selected regions, expected to play a role in memory dysfunction, the fornix also provided good predictors, raising the possibility of investigating how disease propagation within brain networks leads to cognitive deterioration. Our cross-sectional results support that modeling approaches integrating multivariate imaging markers provide sensitive predictors of AD-like behaviors. Such strategies for mapping brain circuits responsible for behaviors may help in the future predict disease progression, or response to interventions.},

Thickness is then defined in terms of a distance measure between the interfaces of this sheet like structure. This technique also provides a natural way to compute continuous estimates of thickness within buried sulci by preventing opposing gray matter banks from intersecting. In addition, the proposed method incorporates neuroanatomical constraints on thickness values as part of the mapping process. Evaluation of this method is presented on synthetic images.

Explicitly minimizing the diffeomorphic metric distance improves the sharpness and accuracy of the derived template. We illustrate this accuracy by computing optimal templates from a simple dataset of ellipses. Our shape optimizing method yields results that reproduce the analytically known optimal template. A related method that uses diffeomorphisms to find an unbiased optimal intensity template does not yield the theoretical result. We show that the improved performance occurs not only in synthetic studies but also when deriving templates from real data. © 2007 IEEE.},

Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},

	abstract = {The goal of this research is to promote variational methods for anatomical averaging that operate within the space of the underlying image registration problem. This approach is effective when using the large deformation viscous framework, where linear averaging is not valid, or in the elastic case. The theory behind this novel atlas building algorithm is similar to the traditional pairwise registration problem, but with single image forces replaced by average forces. These group forces drive an average transport ordinary differential equation allowing one to estimate the geodesic that moves an image toward the mean shape configuration. This model gives large deformation atlases that are optimal with respect to the shape manifold as defined by the data and the image registration assumptions. We use the techniques in the large deformation context here, but they also pertain to small deformation atlas construction. Furthermore, a natural, inherently inverse consistent image registration is gained for free, as is a tool for constant arc length geodesic shape interpolation. The geodesic atlas creation algorithm is quantitatively compared to the Euclidean anatomical average to elucidate the need for optimized atlases. The procedures generate improved average representations of highly variable anatomy from distinct populations. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The algorithm consists of two phases, the first provides an approximated solution, within a small factor, after executing at most d + 1 scans of the data set with a low time complexity cost, where d is the number of dimensions of the data set. During each scan the number of points candidate to belong to the solution set is sensibly reduced. The second phase returns the exact solution by doing a single scan which examines further a little fraction of the data set. Experimental results show that the algorithm always finds the exact solution during the first phase after d̄≪d + 1 steps and it scales linearly both in the dimensionality and the size of the data set. © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Background: Commonly used neuroimaging biomarkers in Parkinson's disease (PD) are useful for diagnosis but poor at predicting outcomes. We explored whether an atrophy pattern from whole-brain structural MRI, measured in the drug-naïve early stage, could predict PD prognosis. Methods: 362 de novo PD patients with T1-weighted MRI (n = 222 for the main analysis, 140 for the validation analysis) were recruited from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We investigated a previously identified PD-specific network atrophy pattern as a potential biomarker of disease severity and prognosis. Progression trajectories of motor function (MDS-UPDRS-part III), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)), and a global composite outcome measure were compared between atrophy tertiles using mixed effect models. The prognostic value of the MRI atrophy measure was compared with 123I ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography, the postural-instability-gait-disturbance score, and cerebrospinal fluid markers. Findings: After 4.5 years follow-up, PD-specific atrophy network score at baseline significantly predicted change in UPDRS-part III (r = −0.197, p =.003), MoCA (r = 0.253, p =.0002) and global composite outcome (r = −0.249, p =.0002). Compared with the 3rd tertile (i.e. least atrophy), the tertile with the highest baseline atrophy (i.e. the 1st tertile) had a 3-point annual faster progression in UPDRS-part III (p =.012), faster worsening of posture-instability gait scores (+0.21 further annual increase, p {\textbackslash}textless.0001), faster decline in MoCA (−0.74 further annual decline in MoCA, p =.0372) and a + 0.38 (p =.0029) faster annual increase in the global composite z-score. All findings were replicated in a validation analysis using 1.5T MRI. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed the superiority of the MRI biomarker, although it had modest AUC values (0.63). By comparison, the other biomarkers were limited in their ability to predict prognosis either in the main or validation analysis. Interpretation: A PD-specific network atrophy pattern predicts progression of motor, cognitive, and global outcome in PD, and is a better predictor of prognosis than any of the other tested biomarkers. Therefore, it has potential as a prognostic biomarker for clinical trials of early PD.},

	abstract = {In task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers seek to measure fMRI signals related to a given task or condition. In many circumstances, measuring this signal of interest is limited by noise. In this study, we present GLMdenoise, a technique that improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by entering noise regressors into a general linear model (GLM) analysis of fMRI data. The noise regressors are derived by conducting an initial model fit to determine voxels unrelated to the experimental paradigm, performing principal components analysis (PCA) on the time-series of these voxels, and using cross-validation to select the optimal number of principal components to use as noise regressors. Due to the use of data resampling, GLMdenoise requires and is best suited for datasets involving multiple runs (where conditions repeat across runs). We show that GLMdenoise consistently improves cross-validation accuracy of GLM estimates on a variety of event-related experimental datasets and is accompanied by substantial gains in SNR. To promote practical application of methods, we provide MATLAB code implementing GLMdenoise. Furthermore, to help compare GLMdenoise to other denoising methods, we present the Denoise Benchmark (DNB), a public database and architecture for evaluating denoising methods. The DNB consists of the datasets described in this paper, a code framework that enables automatic evaluation of a denoising method, and implementations of several denoising methods, including GLMdenoise, the use of motion parameters as noise regressors, ICA-based denoising, and RETROICOR/RVHRCOR. Using the DNB, we find that GLMdenoise performs best out of all of the denoising methods we tested.},

	abstract = {Converging lines of evidence suggest an adverse effect of heavy cannabis use on adolescent brain development, particularly on the hippocampus. In this preliminary study, we compared hippocampal morphology in 14 "treatment-seeking" adolescents (aged 18-20) with a history of prior heavy cannabis use (5.8 joints/day) after an average of 6.7 months of drug abstinence, and 14 demographically matched normal controls. Participants underwent a high-resolution 3D MRI as well as cognitive testing including the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Heavy-cannabis users showed significantly smaller volumes of the right (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.04) and left (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.02) hippocampus, but no significant differences in the amygdala region compared to controls. In controls, larger hippocampus volumes were observed to be significantly correlated with higher CVLT verbal learning and memory scores, but these relationships were not observed in cannabis users. In cannabis users, a smaller right hippocampus volume was correlated with a higher amount of cannabis use (r = -0.57, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.03). These data support a hypothesis that heavy cannabis use may have an adverse effect on hippocampus development. These findings, after an average 6.7 month of supervised abstinence, lend support to a theory that cannabis use may impart long-term structural and functional damage. Alternatively, the observed hippocampal volumetric abnormalities may represent a risk factor for cannabis dependence. These data have potential significance for understanding the observed relationship between early cannabis exposure during adolescence and subsequent development of adult psychopathology reported in the literature for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	issn = {10538119},
	abstract = {We survey the field of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) source estimation. These modalities offer the potential for functional brain mapping with temporal resolution in the millisecond range. However, the limited number of spatial measurements and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem present significant limits to our ability to produce accurate spatial maps from these data without imposing major restrictions on the form of the inverse solution. Here we describe approaches to solving the forward problem of computing the mapping from putative inverse solutions into the data space. We then describe the inverse problem in terms of low dimensional solutions, based on the equivalent current dipole (ECD), and high dimensional solutions, in which images of neural activation are constrained to the cerebral cortex. We also address the issue of objective assessment of the relative performance of inverse procedures by the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve. We conclude with a discussion of methods for assessing statistical significance of experimental results through use of the bootstrap for determining confidence regions in dipole-fitting methods, and random field (RF) and permutation methods for detecting significant activation in cortically constrained imaging studies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We present a robust, high-throughput, semiautomated template-based protocol for segmenting the hippocampus in temporal lobe epilepsy. The semiautomated component of this approach, which minimizes user effort while maximizing the benefit of human input to the algorithm, relies on "incomplete labeling." Incomplete labeling requires the user to quickly and approximately segment a few key regions of the hippocampus through a user-interface. Subsequently, this partial labeling of the hippocampus is combined with image similarity terms to guide volumetric diffeomorphic normalization between an individual brain and an unbiased disease-specific template, with fully labeled hippocampi. We solve this many-to-few and few-to-many matching problem, and gain robustness to inter and intrarater variability and small errors in user labeling, by embedding the template-based normalization within a probabilistic framework that examines both label geometry and appearance data at each label. We evaluate the reliability of this framework with respect to manual labeling and show that it increases minimum performance levels relative to fully automated approaches and provides high inter-rater reliability. Thus, this approach does not require expert neuroanatomical training and is viable for high-throughput studies of both the normal and the highly atrophic hippocampus. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {A multivariate classification approach has been presented to examine the brain abnormalities, i.e., due to prenatal cocaine exposure, using both structural and functional brain images. First, a regional statistical feature extraction scheme was adopted to capture discriminative features from voxel-wise morphometric and functional representations of brain images, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the features used for classification, as well as to achieve the robustness to registration error and inter-subject variations. Then, this feature extraction method was used in conjunction with a hybrid feature selection method and a nonlinear support vector machine for the classification of brain abnormalities. This brain classification approach has been applied to detecting the brain abnormality associated with prenatal cocaine exposure in adolescents. A promising classification performance was achieved on a data set of 49 subjects (24 normal and 25 prenatally cocaine-exposed teenagers), with a leave-one-out cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our method, as well as the importance of incorporating both structural and functional images for brain classification. Moreover, spatial patterns of group difference derived from the constructed classifier were mostly consistent with the results of the conventional statistical analysis method. Therefore, the proposed approach provided not only a multivariate classification method for detecting brain abnormalities, but also an alternative way for group analysis of multimodality images. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, because of the limitations of both conventional imaging modalities and conventional labeling techniques, it is a challenge to localize molecules in three dimensions with high precision in such samples while simultaneously achieving the labeling densities required for high resolution of densely crowded structures. Here we combined lattice light-sheet microscopy with newly developed, freely diffusing, cell-permeable chemical probes with targeted affinity for DNA, intracellular membranes or the plasma membrane. We used this combination to perform high-localization precision, ultrahigh-labeling density, multicolor localization microscopy in samples up to 20 μm thick, including dividing cells and the neuromast organ of a zebrafish embryo. We also demonstrate super-resolution correlative imaging with protein-specific photoactivable fluorophores, providing a mutually compatible, single-platform alternative to correlative light-electron microscopy over large volumes.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suffers from many problems that make signal estimation difficult. These include variation in the hemodynamic response across voxels and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We evaluate several analysis techniques that address these problems for event-related fMRI. (1) Many fMRI analyses assume a canonical hemodynamic response function, but this assumption may lead to inaccurate data models. By adopting the finite impulse response model, we show that voxel-specific hemodynamic response functions can be estimated directly from the data. (2) There is a large amount of low-frequency noise fluctuation (LFF) in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) time-series data. To compensate for this problem, we use polynomials as regressors for LFF. We show that this technique substantially improves SNR and is more accurate than high-pass filtering of the data. (3) Model overfitting is a problem for the finite impulse response model because of the low SNR of the BOLD response. To reduce overfitting, we estimate a hemodynamic response timecourse for each voxel and incorporate the constraint of time-event separability, the constraint that hemodynamic responses across event types are identical up to a scale factor. We show that this technique substantially improves the accuracy of hemodynamic response estimates and can be computed efficiently. For the analysis techniques we present, we evaluate improvement in modeling accuracy via 10-fold cross-validation.},

	abstract = {The effects of early life experience on later brain structure and function have been studied extensively in animals, yet the relationship between childhood experience and normal brain development in humans remains largely unknown. Using a unique longitudinal data set including ecologically valid in-home measures of early experience during childhood (at age 4 and 8 years) and high-resolution structural brain imaging during adolescence (mean age 14 years), we examined the effects on later brain morphology of two dimensions of early experience: parental nurturance and environmental stimulation. Parental nurturance at age 4 predicts the volume of the left hippocampus in adolescence, with better nurturance associated with smaller hippocampal volume. In contrast, environmental stimulation did not correlate with hippocampal volume. Moreover, the association between hippocampal volume and parental nurturance disappears at age 8, supporting the existence of a sensitive developmental period for brain maturation. These findings indicate that variation in normal childhood experience is associated with differences in brain morphology, and hippocampal volume is specifically associated with early parental nurturance. Our results provide neuroimaging evidence supporting the important role of warm parental care during early childhood for brain maturation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

A model of a DCE MRI of the liver incorporating an isotropic elastic non-rigid deformation is used to simulate both breathing and breath-hold data, a volume-preserving modification for tumour regions is included. Contrast enhancement is simulated by applying a pharmacokinetic model. For each simulated dataset, a direct fluid registration of each image to the first in the dataset is compared to a contrast-enhancement guided method known as Progressive Principal Component Registration (PPCR). Analysis of the correction to the deformation fields, tumour volume change and dispersion of joint image histograms are used to show the importance of motion type on PPCR success and of enhancement level on direct fluid registration success. For breathing motion, PPCR registers groups of images to separate locations, but maintains enhancing tumour volume. This is not the case for direct registration with volume changes of up to 7\%. For inconsistent breath-hold depth, PPCR out-performs direct registration, particularly for large enhancement levels. Analysis of the joint histograms suggests that the generation of target images using PPCR reduces dispersion due to contrast enhancement.

Joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) is a tool for exploratory dimension reduction that decomposes a multi-source dataset into three terms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across sources, low-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each source and residual noise. JIVE has been used to explore multi-source data for a variety of application areas but its accessibility was previously limited. We introduce R.JIVE, an intuitive R package to perform JIVE and visualize the results. We discuss several improvements and extensions of the JIVE methodology that are included.

	abstract = {The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available ‘omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5845},
	abstract = {Importance: Despite a hypothesis that harboring a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2(LRRK2) G2019S variation and a glucocerebrosidase (GBA) variant would have a combined deleterious association with disease pathogenesis, milder clinical phenotypes have been reported in dual LRRK2 and GBA variations Parkinson disease (PD) than in GBA variation PD alone. Objective: To evaluate the association of LRRK2 G2019S and GBA variants with longitudinal cognitive and motor decline in PD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study of continuous measures in LRRK2 PD, GBA PD, LRRK2/GBA PD, and wild-type idiopathic PD used pooled annual visit data ranging from 2004 to 2019 from the Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Parkinson Disease Biomarker Program, Harvard Biomarkers Study, Ashkenazi Jewish-LRRK2-Consortium, Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative, and SPOT-PD studies. Patients who were screened for GBA and LRRK2 variations and completed either a motor or cognitive assessment were included. Data were analyzed from May to July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The associations of LRRK2 G2019S and GBA genotypes on the rate of decline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-Part III scores were examined using linear mixed effects models with PD duration as the time scale. Results: Among 1193 individuals with PD (mean [SD] age, 66.6 [9.9] years; 490 [41.2\%] women), 128 (10.7\%) had GBA PD, 155 (13.0\%) had LRRK2 PD, 21 (1.8\%) had LRRK2/GBA PD, and 889 (74.5\%) had idiopathic PD. Patients with GBA PD had faster decline in MoCA than those with LRRK2/GBA PD (B [SE], -0.31 [0.09] points/y; P {\textbackslash}textless.001), LRRK2 PD (B [SE], -0.33 [0.09] points/y; P {\textbackslash}textless.001), or idiopathic PD (B [SE], -0.23 [0.08] points/y; P =.005). There was a LRRK2 G2019S × GBA interaction in MoCA decline (B [SE], 0.22 [0.11] points/y; P =.04), but not after excluding severe GBA variations (B [SE], 0.12 [0.11] points/y; P =.28). Patients with GBA PD had significantly worse motor progression compared with those with idiopathic PD (B [SE], 0.49 [0.22] points/y; P =.03) or LRRK2 PD (B [SE], 0.77 [0.26] points/y; P =.004). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that longitudinal cognitive decline in patients with GBA PD was more severe than in those with LRRK2/GBA PD, which more closely resembled LRRK2 PD. This further supports the notion of a dominant association of LRRK2 on GBA in individuals who carry both and raises the possibility of an LRRK2 × GBA interaction. However, the biological basis of a dominant association or interaction is not clear and is apparently contrary to basic investigations. Study of a larger cohort of individuals with severe GBA variation is warranted..},

	abstract = {The hippocampus is a major structure of interest affected by temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis has traditionally been used to study hippocampal involvement in TLE, although spatial variation of structural and functional pathology have been known to exist within the ROI. In this article, structure-specific analysis (Yushkevich et al. (2007) Neuroimage 35:1516-1530) is applied to the study of both structure and function in TLE patients. This methodology takes into account information about the spatial correspondence of voxels within ROIs on left and right sides of the same subject as well as between subjects. Hippocampal thickness is studied as a measure of structural integrity, and functional activation in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which subjects performed a memory encoding task is studied as a measure of functional integrity. Pronounced disease-related decrease in thickness is found in posterior and anterior hippocampus. A region in the body also shows increased thickness in patients' healthy hippocampi compared with controls. Functional activation in diseased hippocampi is reduced in the body region compared to controls, whereas a region in the tail showing greater right-lateralized activation in controls also shows greater activation in healthy hippocampi compared with the diseased side in patients. Summary measurements generated by integrating quantities of interest over the entire hippocampus can also be used, as is done in conventional ROI analysis. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	issn = {2475-9066},
	doi = {10.21105/joss.02815},
	abstract = {In both theoretical and applied research, it is often of interest to assess the strength of an observed association. This is typically done to allow the judgment of the magnitude of an effect (especially when units of measurement are not meaningful, e.g., in the use of estimated latent variables; Bollen, 1989), to facilitate comparing between predictors' importance within a given model, or both. Though some indices of effect size, such as the correlation coefficient (itself a standardized covariance coefficient) are readily available, other measures are often harder to obtain. effectsize is an R package (R Core Team, 2020) that fills this important gap, providing utilities for easily estimating a wide variety of standardized effect sizes (i.e., effect sizes that are not tied to the units of measurement of the variables of interest) and their confidence intervals (CIs), from a variety of statistical models. effectsize provides easy-to-use functions, with full documentation and explanation of the various effect sizes offered, and is also used by developers of other R packages as the back-end for effect size computation, such as parameters (Lüdecke et al., 2020), ggstatsplot (Patil, 2018), gtsummary (Sjoberg et al., 2020) and more. Comparison to Other Packages effectsize's functionality is in part comparable to packages like lm.beta (Behrendt, 2014), MOTE (Buchanan et al., 2019), and MBESS (K. Kelley, 2020). Yet, there are some notable differences, e.g.: • lm.beta provides standardized regression coefficients for linear models, based on post-hoc model matrix standardization. However, the functionality is available only for a limited number of models (models inheriting from the lm class), whereas effectsize provides support for many types of models, including (generalized) linear mixed models, Bayesian models, and more. Additionally, in additional to post-hoc model matrix standardization, effectsize offers other methods of standardization (see below). • Both MOTE and MBESS provide functions for computing effect sizes such as Cohen's d and effect sizes for ANOVAs (Cohen, 1988), and their confidence intervals. However, both require manual input of For t-statistics, degrees of freedom, and sums of squares for the computation the effect sizes, whereas effectsize can automatically extract this information from the provided models, thus allowing for better ease-of-use as well as reducing any potential for error.

The template mapping is then combined with the intrasubject spatiotemporal map to enable pairwise statistical tests to be performed on a population of normalized time series images. Here, we apply this longitudinal analysis protocol to study the gray matter atrophy patterns induced by frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We sample our normalized spatiotemporal maps at baseline (time zero) and time one year to generate an annualized atrophy map (AAM) that estimates the annual effect of FTD. This spatiotemporal normalization enables us to locate neuroanatomical regions that consistently undergo significant annual gray matter atrophy across the population. We found the majority of annual atrophy to occur in the frontal and temporal lobes in our population of 20 subjects. We also found significant effects in the hippocampus, insula and cingulate gyrus. Our novel results, significant at p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05 after false discovery rate correction, are represented in local template space but also assigned Talairach coordinates and Brodmann and Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) labels. This paper shows the statistical power of symmetric diffeomorphic normalization for performing deformation-based studies of longitudinal atrophy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	abstract = {Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) predicts executive function performance and measures of prefrontal cortical function, but little is known about its anatomical correlates. Structural MRI and demographic data from a sample of 283 healthy children from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development were used to investigate the relationship between SES and prefrontal cortical thickness. Specifically, we assessed the association between two principal measures of childhood SES, family income and parental education, and gray matter thickness in specific subregions of prefrontal cortex and on the asymmetry of these areas. After correcting for multiple comparisons and controlling for potentially confounding variables, parental education significantly predicted cortical thickness in the right anterior cingulate gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. These results suggest that brain structure in frontal regions may provide a meaningful link between SES and cognitive function among healthy, typically developing children. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Prior work has related sentence processing to executive deficits in non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We extended this investigation to patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and PD dementia (PDD) by examining grammatical and working memory components of sentence processing in the full range of patients with Lewy body spectrum disorder (LBSD). Thirty-three patients with LBSD were given a two-alternative, forced-choice sentence-picture matching task. Sentence type, working memory, and grammatical structure were systematically manipulated in the sentences. We found that patients with PDD and DLB were significantly impaired relative to non-demented PD patients and healthy controls. The deficit in PDD/DLB was most pronounced for sentences lengthened by the strategic placement of an additional prepositional phrase and for sentences with an additional proposition due to a center-embedded clause. However, there was no effect for subject-relative versus object-relative grammatical structure. An MRI voxel-based morphometry analysis in a subset of patients showed significant gray matter thinning in the frontal lobe bilaterally, and this extended to temporal, parietal and occipital regions. A regression analysis related sentence processing difficulty in LBSD to frontal neocortex, including inferior prefrontal, premotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, as well as right superior temporal cortex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with PDD and DLB have difficulty processing sentences with increased working memory demands and that this deficit is related in part to their frontal disease. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12918-016-0312-1},
	abstract = {Background: Recently, structured sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) has received increased attention in brain imaging genetics studies. It can identify bi-multivariate imaging genetic associations as well as select relevant features with desired structure information. These SCCA methods either use the fused lasso regularizer to induce the smoothness between ordered features, or use the signed pairwise difference which is dependent on the estimated sign of sample correlation. Besides, several other structured SCCA models use the group lasso or graph fused lasso to encourage group structure, but they require the structure/group information provided in advance which sometimes is not available. Results: We propose a new structured SCCA model, which employs the graph OSCAR (GOSCAR) regularizer to encourage those highly correlated features to have similar or equal canonical weights. Our GOSCAR based SCCA has two advantages: 1) It does not require to pre-define the sign of the sample correlation, and thus could reduce the estimation bias. 2) It could pull those highly correlated features together no matter whether they are positively or negatively correlated. We evaluate our method using both synthetic data and real data. Using the 191 ROI measurements of amyloid imaging data, and 58 genetic markers within the APOE gene, our method identifies a strong association between APOE SNP rs429358 and the amyloid burden measure in the frontal region. In addition, the estimated canonical weights present a clear pattern which is preferable for further investigation. Conclusions: Our proposed method shows better or comparable performance on the synthetic data in terms of the estimated correlations and canonical loadings. It has successfully identified an important association between an Alzheimer's disease risk SNP rs429358 and the amyloid burden measure in the frontal region.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is an observational, international study designed to establish biomarker-defined cohorts and identify clinical, imaging, genetic, and biospecimen Parkinson's disease (PD) progression markers to accelerate disease-modifying therapeutic trials. Methods: A total of 423 untreated PD, 196 Healthy Control (HC) and 64 SWEDD (scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit) subjects were enrolled at 24 sites. To enroll PD subjects as early as possible following diagnosis, subjects were eligible with only asymmetric bradykinesia or tremor plus a dopamine transporter (DAT) binding deficit on SPECT imaging. Acquisition of data was standardized as detailed at www.ppmi-info.org. Results: Approximately 9\% of enrolled subjects had a single PD sign at baseline. DAT imaging excluded 16\% of potential PD subjects with SWEDD. The total MDS-UPDRS for PD was 32.4 compared to 4.6 for HC and 28.2 for SWEDD. On average, PD subjects demonstrated 45\% and 68\% reduction in mean striatal and contralateral putamen Specific Binding Ratios (SBR), respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was acquired from {\textbackslash}textgreater97\% of all subjects. CSF (PD/HC/SWEDD pg/mL) alpha-synuclein (1845/2204/2141) was reduced in PD vs HC or SWEDD (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.03). Similarly, t-tau (45/53) and p-tau (16/18) were reduced in PD versus HC (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01),. Interpretation: PPMI has detailed the biomarker signature for an early PD cohort defined by clinical features and imaging biomarkers. This strategy provides the framework to establish biomarker cohorts and to define longitudinal progression biomarkers to support future PD treatment trials.},

	abstract = {While many neuroscience questions aim to understand the human brain, much current knowledge has been gained using animal models, which replicate genetic, structural, and connectivity aspects of the human brain. While voxel-based analysis (VBA) of preclinical magnetic resonance images is widely-used, a thorough examination of the statistical robustness, stability, and error rates is hindered by high computational demands of processing large arrays, and the many parameters involved therein. Thus, workflows are often based on intuition or experience, while preclinical validation studies remain scarce. To increase throughput and reproducibility of quantitative small animal brain studies, we have developed a publicly shared, high throughput VBA pipeline in a high-performance computing environment, called SAMBA. The increased computational efficiency allowed large multidimensional arrays to be processed in 1–3 days—a task that previously took ∼1 month. To quantify the variability and reliability of preclinical VBA in rodent models, we propose a validation framework consisting of morphological phantoms, and four metrics. This addresses several sources that impact VBA results, including registration and template construction strategies. We have used this framework to inform the VBA workflow parameters in a VBA study for a mouse model of epilepsy. We also present initial efforts towards standardizing small animal neuroimaging data in a similar fashion with human neuroimaging. We conclude that verifying the accuracy of VBA merits attention, and should be the focus of a broader effort within the community. The proposed framework promotes consistent quality assurance of VBA in preclinical neuroimaging, thus facilitating the creation and communication of robust results.},

	abstract = {Alternating minimization represents a widely applicable and empirically successful approach for finding low-rank matrices that best fit the given data. For example, for the problem of low-rank matrix completion, this method is believed to be one of the most accurate and efficient, and formed a major component of the winning entry in the Netflix Challenge [17]. In the alternating minimization approach, the low-rank target matrix is written in a bi-linear form, i.e. X = UV † ; the algorithm then alternates between finding the best U and the best V . Typically, each alternating step in isolation is convex and tractable. However the overall problem becomes non-convex and is prone to local minima. In fact, there has been almost no theoretical understanding of when this approach yields a good result. In this paper we present one of the first theoretical analyses of the performance of alternating minimization for matrix completion, and the related problem of matrix sensing. For both these problems, celebrated recent results have shown that they become well-posed and tractable once certain (now standard) conditions are imposed on the problem. We show that alternating minimization also succeeds under similar conditions. Moreover, compared to existing results, our paper shows that alternating minimization guarantees faster (in particular, geometric) convergence to the true matrix, while allowing a significantly simpler analysis.

An alternative is to average responses over multiple subjects that were presented with identical stimuli, but differences in geometry of brain sources and sensors reduce the effectiveness of this solution. Multiway canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) brings a solution to this problem by allowing data from multiple subjects to be fused in such a way as to extract components common to all.

	doi = {10.1214/12-AOS1032},
	abstract = {Many statistical \vphantom{\{}\}M\vphantom{\{}\}-estimators are based on convex optimization problems formed by the combination of a data-dependent loss function with a norm-based regularizer. We analyze the convergence rates of projected gradient and composite gradient methods for solving such problems, working within a high-dimensional framework that allows the data dimension \vphantom{\{}\}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashpdim\{{\textbackslash}backslash\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\} to grow with (and possibly exceed) the sample size \}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashnumobs\{{\textbackslash}backslash\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}. This high-dimensional structure precludes the usual global assumptions—namely, strong convexity and smoothness conditions—that underlie much of classical optimization analysis. We define appropriately restricted versions of these conditions, and show that they are satisfied with high probability for various statistical models. Under these conditions, our theory guarantees that projected gradient descent has a globally geometric rate of convergence up to the \vphantom{\{}\}{\textbackslash}backslash\}emph\{statistical precision\vphantom{\{}\} of the model, meaning the typical distance between the true unknown parameter \}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashtheta\{{\textbackslash}backslash{\textasciicircum}\{\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}*\} and an optimal solution \}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashhat\{{\textbackslash}backslash\{\}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashtheta\{{\textbackslash}backslash\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}. This result is substantially sharper than previous convergence results, which yielded sublinear convergence, or linear convergence only up to the noise level. Our analysis applies to a wide range of \vphantom{\{}\}M\}-estimators and statistical models, including sparse linear regression using Lasso (\}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashell\{{\textbackslash}backslash\_\vphantom{\{}\}1\}-regularized regression); group Lasso for block sparsity; log-linear models with regularization; low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization; and matrix decomposition. Overall, our analysis reveals interesting connections between statistical precision and computational efficiency in high-dimensional estimation.},

	abstract = {Measurement of brain change due to neurodegenerative disease and treatment is one of the fundamental tasks of neuroimaging. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) has been long recognized as an effective and sensitive tool for estimating the change in the volume of brain regions over time. This paper demonstrates that a straightforward application of DBM to estimate the change in the volume of the hippocampus can result in substantial bias, i.e., an overestimation of the rate of change in hippocampal volume. In ADNI data, this bias is manifested as a non-zero intercept of the regression line fitted to the 6 and 12 month rates of hippocampal atrophy. The bias is further confirmed by applying DBM to repeat scans of subjects acquired on the same day. This bias appears to be the result of asymmetry in the interpolation of baseline and followup images during longitudinal image registration. Correcting this asymmetry leads to bias-free atrophy estimation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	title = {Spatial normalization of injured brains for neuroimaging research : {An} illustrative introduction of available options},
	abstract = {Recent advances in neuroimaging methods have allowed researchers to obtain various structural and functional parameters from an individual in a whole-brain, voxel- wise manner. To conduct group level analyses utilizing such data, a one-to-one correspondence between voxels2 across individuals must be identified. The most common approach to this problem is registering individual brains to a standard template. Many sophisticated spatial registration methods are available for this purpose. However, when individual variability of the brains in the study population is substantially increased by injury or disease, achieving a satisfactory alignment across individual brains using the currently available registration protocols becomes a challenging task. Resorting to manual region-of-interest (ROI) drawing or using affine-only transformation may not be viable options because precise spatial normalization is a prerequisite for various powerful voxel-based techniques such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM; Ashburner \& Friston, 2000), tensor-based (or deformation-based) morphometry (TBM or DBM; Ashburner et al., 1998; Gaser, Volz, Kiebel, Riehemann, \& Sauer, 1999; Thompson, Woods, Mega, \& Toga, 2000), voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM; Rorden \& Karnath, 2004), and coordinate-based voxel-wise meta-analyses (Fox, Laird, \& Lancaster, 2005).},

	doi = {10.21105/joss.01294},
	abstract = {Brain imaging researchers regularly work with large, heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets. Historically, researchers have dealt with this complexity idiosyncratically, with every lab or individual implementing their own preprocessing and analysis procedures. The resulting lack of field-wide standards has severely limited reproducibility and data sharing and reuse. To address this problem, we and others recently introduced the Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS; (Gorgolewski et al., 2016)), a specification meant to standardize the process of representing brain imaging data. BIDS is deliberately designed with adoption in mind; it adheres to a user-focused philosophy that prioritizes common use cases and discourages complexity. By successfully encouraging a large and ever-growing subset of the community to adopt a common standard for naming and organizing files, BIDS has made it much easier for researchers to share, re-use, and process their data (Gorgolewski et al., 2017). The ability to efficiently develop high-quality spec-compliant applications itself depends to a large extent on the availability of good tooling. Because many operations recur widely across diverse contexts-for example, almost every tool designed to work with BIDS datasets involves regular file-filtering operations-there is a strong incentive to develop utility libraries that provide common functionality via a standardized, simple API. PyBIDS is a Python package that makes it easier to work with BIDS datasets. In principle, its scope includes virtually any functionality that is likely to be of general use when working with BIDS datasets (i.e., that is not specific to one narrow context). At present, its core and most widely used module supports simple and flexible querying and manipulation of BIDS datasets. PyBIDS makes it easy for researchers and developers working in Python to search for BIDS files by keywords and/or metadata; to consolidate and retrieve file-associated metadata spread out across multiple levels of a BIDS hierarchy; to construct BIDS-valid path names for new files; and to validate projects against the BIDS specification, among other applications.},

The model of CA is a Grenander deformable template, an orbit generated from a template under groups of diffeomorphisms. The metric space of all anatomical images is constructed from the geodesic connecting one anatomical structure to another in the orbit. The variational problems specifying these metrics are reviewed along with their associated Euler-Lagrange equations. The Euler equations of motion derived by Arnold for the geodesics in the group of divergence-free volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of incompressible fluids are generalized for the larger group of diffeomorphisms used in CA with nonconstant Jacobians. Metrics that accommodate photometric variation are described extending the anatomical model to incorporate the construction of neoplasm. Metrics on landmarked shapes are reviewed as well as Joshi's diffeomorphism metrics, Bookstein's thin-plate spline approximate-metrics, and Kendall's affine invariant metrics. We conclude by showing recent experimental results from the Toga \& Thompson group in growth, the Van Essen group in macaque and human cortex mapping, and the Csernansky group in hippocampus mapping for neuropsychiatric studies in aging and schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Background: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is most commonly associated with TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) or tau pathology at autopsy, but there are no in vivo biomarkers reliably discriminating between sporadic cases. As disease-modifying treatments emerge, it is critical to accurately identify underlying pathology in living patients so that they can be entered into appropriate etiology-directed clinical trials. Patients with tau inclusions (FTLD-TAU) appear to have relatively greater white matter (WM) disease at autopsy than those patients with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). In this paper, we investigate the ability of white matter (WM) imaging to help discriminate between FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP during life using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: Patients with autopsy-confirmed disease or a genetic mutation consistent with FTLD-TDP or FTLD-TAU underwent multimodal T1 volumetric MRI and diffusion weighted imaging scans. We quantified cortical thickness in GM and fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM. We performed Eigenanatomy, a statistically robust dimensionality reduction algorithm, and used leave-oneout cross-validation to predict underlying pathology. Neuropathological assessment of GM and WM disease burden was performed in the autopsy-cases to confirm our findings of an ante-mortem GM and WM dissociation in the neuroimaging cohort. Results: ROC curve analyses evaluated classification accuracy in individual patients and revealed 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for WM analyses. FTLDTAU had significantly more WM degeneration and inclusion severity at autopsy relative to FTLD-TDP. Conclusions: These neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations provide converging evidence for greater WM burden associated with FTLDTAU, and emphasise the role of WM neuroimaging for in vivo discrimination between FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP.},

	abstract = {A component based method (CompCor) for the reduction of noise in both blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and perfusion-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is presented. In the proposed method, significant principal components are derived from noise regions-of-interest (ROI) in which the time series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity. These components are then included as nuisance parameters within general linear models for BOLD and perfusion-based fMRI time series data. Two approaches for the determination of the noise ROI are considered. The first method uses high-resolution anatomical data to define a region of interest composed primarily of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second method defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of the time series data. With the application of CompCor, the temporal standard deviation of resting-state perfusion and BOLD data in gray matter regions was significantly reduced as compared to either no correction or the application of a previously described retrospective image based correction scheme (RETROICOR). For both functional perfusion and BOLD data, the application of CompCor significantly increased the number of activated voxels as compared to no correction. In addition, for functional BOLD data, there were significantly more activated voxels detected with CompCor as compared to RETROICOR. In comparison to RETROICOR, CompCor has the advantage of not requiring external monitoring of physiological fluctuations.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.012},
	abstract = {Background: We present an image analysis framework geared towards development of focal MRI biomarkers based on hippocampal subfields. This includes: 1) An automatic segmentation method that can reliably label hippocampal subfields, with accuracy comparable to manual labeling protocols (Neuroimage, 53:1208), 2) An automated analysis pipeline for measuring longitudinal atrophy rates within subfields, and 3) A detailed computational atlas of the human hippocampus constructed from MRI and histopathological staining of autopsy samples (Neuroimage, 50:434). We present preliminary studies using this framework. Methods: Focal T2-weighted MRI (HFMRI) were obtained with high resolution slices (0.5x0.6x2.6 mm3 for cross-sectional and 0.4x0.4x2 mm3 for longitudinal cohort), oriented orthogonal to the main axis of the hippocampus (see figure). We labeled subfields using our automatic segmentation technique, that uses a multiatlas based label fusion approach, and computed their normalized volume and thickness. Anisotropic resolution makes normalization (Figure presented) of baseline and 1-3 year follow up HFMRI challenging for longitudinal atrophy estimation.We align a small ROI around the hippocampus, providing better accuracy than whole brain normalization, followed by our unbiased deformation based morphometry strategy (Neuroimage, 50:434). In the cross-sectional study, CA1 had greater thickness in controls compared to MCI patients. Left CA1, DG, and whole hippocampus had most significant volume differences. In the longitudinal study, CA1 and HEAD had significant tissue shrinkage only in the patient group, which were also significantly greater than controls. The computational atlas has been enhanced using additional specimens undergoing both histological staining MRI scans. This will improve subfield labeling accuracy, and help label additional ROIs, e.g. perirhinal and postrhinal cortices. Conclusions: All software and the atlas are being made publicly available as development continues. The automated segmentation methodology lays the foundation for a cost-effective processing pipeline for in vivo data in large clinical studies where manual segmentation is prohibitively expensive. This technology enables group studies, including longitudinal studies, that require ROI labels. Further, we have attempted to address the challenges of measuring longitudinal change from HFMRI. We anticipate that enhancement of the atlas through histology data and refinement of analysis methods will reveal greater subfield- specific effects in larger datasets.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jmva.2007.06.007},
	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used tool for data analysis and dimension reduction in applications throughout science and engineering. However, the principal components (PCs) can sometimes be difficult to interpret, because they are linear combinations of all the original variables. To facilitate interpretation, sparse PCA produces modified PCs with sparse loadings, i.e. loadings with very few non-zero elements. In this paper, we propose a new sparse PCA method, namely sparse PCA via regularized SVD (sPCA-rSVD). We use the connection of PCA with singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix and extract the PCs through solving a low rank matrix approximation problem. Regularization penalties are introduced to the corresponding minimization problem to promote sparsity in PC loadings. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed for computation. Two tuning parameter selection methods are discussed. Some theoretical results are established to justify the use of sPCA-rSVD when only the data covariance matrix is available. In addition, we give a modified definition of variance explained by the sparse PCs. The sPCA-rSVD provides a uniform treatment of both classical multivariate data and high-dimension-low-sample-size (HDLSS) data. Further understanding of sPCA-rSVD and some existing alternatives is gained through simulation studies and real data examples, which suggests that sPCA-rSVD provides competitive results. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Our objective is to use both modalities to build subject-specific, quantitative models of fiber connections in order to discover effects specific to a neural system. The health of this thalamo-cortical network is compromised by traumatic brain injury, and we hypothesize that these effects are due to a primary injury to the thalamus which results in subsequent compromise of radiating fibers. We first use a population-specific average Tl and DT template to label the thalamus and Brodmann areas (BA) 9,10 and 11 in each subject. We also build an expected connection model within this template space that is transferred to subject space in order to provide a prior restriction on probabilistic tracking performed in subject space. We evaluate the effect of traumatic brain injury on this prefrontal-thalamus network by quantifying, in 10 subjects and 8 controls, the mean diffusion and fractional anisotropy along fiber tracts, along with the mean diffusion within the thalamus and cortical regions. We contrast results gained by a template-based tract definition with those gained by performing analysis in the subject space. Both approaches reveal connectivity effects of TBI, specifically a region of reduced FA in the white matter connecting the thalamus to BA 10. © 2008 IEEE.},

Establishing biomarkers of the neuroanatomical aging processes exemplifies a new trend in neuroscience in order to provide risk-assessments and predictions for age-associated neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases at a single-subject level. The “Brain Age Gap Estimation (BrainAGE)” method constitutes the first and actually most widely applied concept for predicting and evaluating individual brain age based on structural MRI. This review summarizes all studies published within the last 10 years that have established and utilized the BrainAGE method to evaluate the effects of interaction of genes, environment, life burden, diseases, or life time on individual neuroanatomical aging. In future, BrainAGE and other brain age prediction approaches based on structural or functional markers may improve the assessment of individual risks for neurological, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases as well as aid in developing personalized neuroprotective treatments and interventions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast MRI. A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

A fourth subtype, minimal atrophy AD, has been identified in several neuroimaging studies. Typical AD displays tau-related pathology and atrophy both in hippocampus and association cortex and has a pooled frequency of 55\%. Limbic-predominant, hippocampal-sparing, and minimal atrophy AD had a pooled frequency of 21\%, 17\%, and 15\%, respectively. Between-subtype differences were found in age at onset, age at assessment, sex distribution, years of education, global cognitive status, disease duration, APOE ϵ4 genotype, and CSF biomarker levels.ConclusionWe identified 2 core dimensions of heterogeneity: typicality and severity. We propose that these 2 dimensions determine individuals' belonging to one of the AD subtypes based on the combination of protective factors, risk factors, and concomitant non-AD brain pathologies. This model is envisioned to aid with framing hypotheses, study design, interpretation of results, and understanding mechanisms in future subtype studies. Our model can be used along the A/T/N classification scheme for AD biomarkers. Unraveling the heterogeneity within AD is critical for implementing precision medicine approaches and for ultimately developing successful disease-modifying drugs for AD.},

The deformed atlases were created by elastically mapping an anatomical brain atlas onto different MR brain image volumes. The mapping matches the edges of the ventricles and the surface of the brain; the resultant deformations are propagated through the atlas volume, deforming the remainder of the structures in the process. The atlas was then elastically matched to its deformed versions. The accuracy of the resultant matches was evaluated by determining the correspondence of 32 cortical and subcortical structures. The system on average matched the centroid of a structure to within 1 mm of its true position and fit a structure to within 11\% of its true volume. The overlap between the matched and true structures, defined by the ratio between the volume of their intersection and the volume of their union, averaged 66\%. When the gray-white interface was included for matching, the mean overlap improved to 78\%; each structure was matched to within 0.6 mm of its true position and fit to within 6\% of its true volume. Preliminary studies were also made to determine the effect of the compliance of the atlas on the resultant match.},

	abstract = {Motivation Brain imaging genetics, which studies the linkage between genetic variations and structural or functional measures of the human brain, has become increasingly important in recent years. Discovering the bi-multivariate relationship between genetic markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroimaging quantitative traits (QTs) is one major task in imaging genetics. Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) has been a popular technique in this area for its powerful capability in identifying bi-multivariate relationships coupled with feature selection. The existing SCCA methods impose either the â.," 1-norm or its variants to induce sparsity. The â.," 0-norm penalty is a perfect sparsity-inducing tool which, however, is an NP-hard problem. Results In this paper, we propose the truncated â.," 1-norm penalized SCCA to improve the performance and effectiveness of the â.," 1-norm based SCCA methods. Besides, we propose an efficient optimization algorithms to solve this novel SCCA problem. The proposed method is an adaptive shrinkage method via tuning I.,. It can avoid the time intensive parameter tuning if given a reasonable small I.,. Furthermore, we extend it to the truncated group-lasso (TGL), and propose TGL-SCCA model to improve the group-lasso-based SCCA methods. The experimental results, compared with four benchmark methods, show that our SCCA methods identify better or similar correlation coefficients, and better canonical loading profiles than the competing methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods in discovering interesting imaging genetic associations.},

Structural MRI and demographic data from a sample of 283 healthy children in the first wave of the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development were used to systematically investigate the relationship between SES and frontal cortical thickness. Specifically, we assessed the association between two principal measures of childhood SES, family income and parental education, on grey matter thickness in specific subregions of prefrontal cortex and on the asymmetry of these areas. After correcting for multiple comparisons and controlling for potentially confounding variables, parental education significantly predicted cortical thickness in the right anterior cingulate gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. These results suggest that brain structure in frontal regions may provide a meaningful link between SES and cognitive function among healthy, typically developing children.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in MRI and increasing knowledge on the characterization and anatomical variability of medial temporal lobe (MTL) anatomy have paved the way for more specific subdivisions of the MTL in humans. In addition, recent studies suggest that early changes in many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases are better detected in smaller subregions of the MTL rather than with whole structure analyses. Here, we developed a new protocol using 7 Tesla (T) MRI incorporating novel anatomical findings for the manual segmentation of entorhinal cortex (ErC), perirhinal cortex (PrC; divided into area 35 and 36), parahippocampal cortex (PhC), and hippocampus; which includes the subfields subiculum (Sub), CA1, CA2, as well as CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) which are separated by the endfolial pathway covering most of the long axis of the hippocampus. We provide detailed instructions alongside slice-by-slice segmentations to ease learning for the untrained but also more experienced raters. Twenty-two subjects were scanned (19–32 yrs, mean age = 26 years, 12 females) with a turbo spin echo (TSE) T2-weighted MRI sequence with high-resolution oblique coronal slices oriented orthogonal to the long axis of the hippocampus (in-plane resolution 0.44 × 0.44 mm2) and 1.0 mm slice thickness. The scans were manually delineated by two experienced raters, to assess intra- and inter-rater reliability. The Dice Similarity Index (DSI) was above 0.78 for all regions and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) were between 0.76 to 0.99 both for intra- and inter-rater reliability. In conclusion, this study presents a fine-grained and comprehensive segmentation protocol for MTL structures at 7 T MRI that closely follows recent knowledge from anatomical studies. More specific subdivisions (e.g. area 35 and 36 in PrC, and the separation of DG and CA3) may pave the way for more precise delineations thereby enabling the detection of early volumetric changes in dementia and neuropsychiatric diseases.},

Background: FTLD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with behavioral disturbances. Group studies have related these behaviors to volume loss on MRI. Methods: Forty caregivers of patients with the clinical diagnosis of FTLD completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Twelve neuropsychiatric symptoms and the associated caregiver distress were assessed. Optimized voxel-based morphometry identified significant atrophy in subgroups of FTLD patients with isolated behavioral symptoms corresponding to the most distressing behaviors, and we correlated cortical atrophy directly with these distressing behavioral disorders in an unbiased group analysis. Results: The greatest stressors for caregivers were apathy and disinhibition (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.005 for both contrasts). Partially distinct areas of cortical atrophy were associated with these behaviors in both individual patients with these symptoms and group-wide analyses, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in apathetic patients, and the medial orbital frontal cortex in disinhibited patients. Conclusions: Caregiver stress in families of FTLD patients is due in large part to apathy and disinhibition.

	title = {Overall concordance correlation coefficient for evaluating agreement among multiple observers},
	abstract = {Accurate and precise measurement is an important component of any proper study design. As elaborated by Lin (1989, Biometrics 45, 255-268), the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is more appropriate than other indices for measuring agreement when the variable of interest is continuous. However, this agreement index is defined in the context of comparing two fixed observers. In order to use multiple observers in a study involving large numbers of subjects, there is a need to assess agreement among these multiple observers. In this article, we present an overall CCC (OCCC) in terms of the interobserver variability for assessing agreement among multiple fixed observers. The OCCC turns out to be equivalent to the generalized CCC (King and Chinchilli, 2001, Statistics in Medicine 20, 2131-2147; Lin, 1989; Lin, 2000, Biometrics 56, 324-325) when the squared distance function is used. We evaluated the OCCC through generalized estimating equations (Barnhart and Williamson, 2001, Biometrics 57, 931-940) and U-statistics (King and Chinchilli, 2001) for inference. This article offers the following important points. First, it addresses the precision and accuracy indices as components of the OCCC. Second, it clarifies that the OCCC is the weighted average of all pairwise CCCs. Third, it is intuitively defined in terms of interobserver variability. Fourth, the inference approaches of GEE and the U-statistics are compared via simulations for small samples. Fifth, we illustrate the use of the OCCC by two medical examples with the GEE, U-statistics, and bootstrap approaches.},

	volume = {25},
	doi = {10.1109/TMI.2005.861015},
	abstract = {We present research in which both left and right ventricular deformation is estimated from tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using volumetric deformable models constructed from nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The four model types considered and compared for the left ventricle include two Cartesian NURBS models–one with a cylindrical parameter assignment and one with a prolate spheroidal parameter assignment. The remaining two are non-Cartesian, i.e., prolate spheroidal and cylindrical each with their respective prolate spheroidal and cylindrical parameter assignment regimes. These choices were made based on the typical shape of the left ventricle. For each frame starting with end-diastole, a NURBS model is constructed by fitting two surfaces with the same parameterization to the corresponding set of epicardial and endocardial contours from which a volumetric model is created. Using normal displacements of the three sets of orthogonal tag planes as well as displacements of contour/tag line intersection points and tag plane intersection points, one can solve for the optimal homogeneous coordinates, in a weighted least squares sense, of the control points of the deformed NURBS model at end-diastole using quadratic programming. This allows for subsequent nonrigid registration of the biventricular model at end-diastole to all later time frames. After registration of the model to all later time points, the registered NURBS models are temporally lofted in order to create a comprehensive four-dimensional NURBS model. From the lofted model, we can extract three-dimensional myocardial deformation fields and corresponding Lagrangian and Eulerian strain maps which are local measures of nonrigid deformation. The results show that, in the case of simulated data, the quadratic Cartesian NURBS models with the cylindrical and prolate spheroidal parameter assignments outperform their counterparts in predicting normal strain. The decreased complexity associated with the Cartesian model with the cylindrical parameter assignment prompted its use for subsequent calculations. Lagrangian strains in three canine data, a normal human, and a patient with history of myocardial infarction are presented. Eulerian strains for the normal human data are also included.},

	abstract = {In most supervised domain adaptation learning (DAL) tasks, one has access only to a small number of labeled examples from target domain. Therefore the success of supervised DAL in this "small sample" regime needs the effective utilization of the large amounts of unlabeled data to extract information that is useful for generalization. Toward this end, we here use the geometric intuition of manifold assumption to extend the established frameworks in existing model-based DAL methods for function learning by incorporating additional information about the target geometric structure of the marginal distribution. We would like to ensure that the solution is smooth with respect to both the ambient space and the target marginal distribution. In doing this, we propose a novel L1-norm locally linear representation regularization multi-source adaptation learning framework which exploits the geometry of the probability distribution, which has two techniques. Firstly, an L1-norm locally linear representation method is presented for robust graph construction by replacing the L2-norm reconstruction measure in LLE with L1-norm one, which is termed as L1-LLR for short. Secondly, considering the robust graph regularization, we replace traditional graph Laplacian regularization with our new L1-LLR graph Laplacian regularization and therefore construct new graph-based semi-supervised learning framework with multi-source adaptation constraint, which is coined as L1-MSAL method. Moreover, to deal with the nonlinear learning problem, we also generalize the L1-MSAL method by mapping the input data points from the input space to a high-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a nonlinear mapping. Promising experimental results have been obtained on several real-world datasets such as face, visual video and object.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although it is important to evaluate the substantia nigra in patients with parkinsonian syndrome, it is difficult to depict its anatomy, even by MR imaging. Using anatomic studies of the direction of nerve fibers around the snbstantia nigra, we attempted to depict this entity with multishot diffusion-weighted MR imaging to evaluate its topographic changes in patients with Parkinson's disease and secondary parkinsonism. METHODS: We measured the substantia nigra on 72 diffusion- weighted axial MR images obtained in 36 healthy control subjects, on 47 images obtained in 25 patients with Parkinson's disease, and on 10 images obtained in five patients with secondary parkinsonism. We considered the width of the minor axis of the substantia nigra as its 'thickness,' which appeared as a crescent-shaped region in the midbrain. RESULTS: Diffusion- weighted imaging portrayed the substantia nigra distinctly better than did T2-weighted imaging, because the surrounding white matter appeared as an area of high signal intensity. The mean (± SD) thickness values of the substantia nigra were 5.1 ± 0.89 mm in control subjects, 4.8 ± 0.75 mm in patients with Parkinson's disease, and 3.4 ± 0.53 mm in patients with secondary parkinsonism. CONCLUSION: Multishot diffusion-weighted imaging is a better imaging technique than T2-weighted imaging for demonstrating a change in size of the substantia nigra in vivo. The substantia nigra is not reduced in size in patients with Parkinson's disease, but it is reduced in patients with secondary parkinsonism.},

	abstract = {The ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been implicated in social and affectively influenced decision-making. Disease in this region may have clinical consequences for social judgments in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). To test this hypothesis, regional cortical activation was monitored with fMRI while healthy adults judged the acceptability of brief social scenarios such as cutting into a movie ticket line or going through a red light at 2. AM. The scenarios described: (i) a socially neutral condition, (ii) a variant of each scenario containing a negatively valenced feature, and (iii) a variant containing a positively valenced feature. Results revealed that healthy adults activated vmPFC during judgments of negatively valenced scenarios relative to positive scenarios and neutral scenarios. In a comparative behavioral study, the same social decision-making paradigm was administered to patients with a social disorder due to FTLD. Patients differed significantly from healthy controls, specifically showing less sensitivity to negatively valenced features. Comparative anatomical analysis revealed considerable overlap of vmPFC activation in healthy adults and vmPFC cortical atrophy in FTLD patients. These converging results support the role of vmPFC in social decision-making where potentially negative consequences must be considered. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Second, we rigorously prove that using only this set of random projections, we can estimate the structure of the underlying manifold. In both cases, the number of random projections required is linear in K and logarithmic in N, meaning that K {\textbackslash}textless M ≪ N. To handle practical situations, we develop a greedy algorithm to estimate the smallest size of the projection space required to perform manifold learning. Our method is particularly relevant in distributed sensing systems and leads to significant potential savings in data acquisition, storage and transmission costs.},

The proposed solution is fully graph-based, without any need for additional search structures (typically used at the coarse search stage of the most proximity graph techniques). Hierarchical NSW incrementally builds a multi-layer structure consisting of a hierarchical set of proximity graphs (layers) for nested subsets of the stored elements. The maximum layer in which an element is present is selected randomly with an exponentially decaying probability distribution. This allows producing graphs similar to the previously studied Navigable Small World (NSW) structures while additionally having the links separated by their characteristic distance scales. Starting the search from the upper layer together with utilizing the scale separation boosts the performance compared to NSW and allows a logarithmic complexity scaling. Additional employment of a heuristic for selecting proximity graph neighbors significantly increases performance at high recall and in case of highly clustered data. Performance evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed general metric space search index is able to strongly outperform previous opensource state-of-the-art vector-only approaches. Similarity of the algorithm to the skip list structure allows straightforward balanced distributed implementation.},

Here, we explore the impact of target and reference region-of-interest (ROI) selection on SUVR effect sizes using interventional data from the ongoing phase 1b PRIME study (NCT01677572) of aducanumab (BIIB037) in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Methods: The florbetapir PET SUVR was calculated at baseline (screening) and at weeks 26 and 54 for patients randomized to receive placebo and each of 4 aducanumab doses (1, 3, 6, and 10 mg/kg) using the whole cerebellum, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, pons, and subcortical white matter as reference regions. In addition to the prespecified composite cortex target ROI, individual cerebral cortical ROIs were assessed as targets. Results: Of the reference regions used, subcortical white matter, cerebellar white matter, and the pons, alone or in combination, generated the largest effect sizes. The use of the anterior cingulate cortex as a target ROI resulted in larger effect sizes than the use of the composite cortex. SUVR calculations were not affected by correction for brain volume changes over time. Conclusion: Dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid PET SUVR were consistently observed with aducanumab only in cortical regions prone to amyloid plaque deposition, regardless of the reference region used. These data support the hypothesis that florbetapir SUVR responses associated with aducanumab treatment are a result of specific dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid burden in patients with Alzheimer disease.},

If the populations are initially in linkage equilibrium, then the mean value of D remains zero with inbreeding, but the mean of D2 increases to a maximum value and decreases until fixation is reached at both loci. The tighter the linkage and the greater the selection, then the later is the maximum in the mean of D2 reached, and the larger its value.

It was found that, for a range of selection intensities and initial gene frequencies, the mean value of r2 was determined almost entirely by N c and time, measured proportional to N.

	abstract = {As clinical and cognitive neuroscience mature, the need for sophisticated neuroimaging analysis becomes more apparent. Multivariate analysis techniques have recently received increasing attention as they have many attractive features that cannot be easily realized by the more commonly used univariate, voxel-wise, techniques. Multivariate approaches evaluate correlation/covariance of activation across brain regions, rather than proceeding on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Thus, their results can be more easily interpreted as a signature of neural networks. Univariate approaches, on the other hand, cannot directly address functional connectivity in the brain. The covariance approach can also result in greater statistical power when compared with univariate techniques, which are forced to employ very stringent, and often overly conservative, corrections for voxel-wise multiple comparisons. Multivariate techniques also lend themselves much better to prospective application of results from the analysis of one dataset to entirely new datasets. Multivariate techniques are thus well placed to provide information about mean differences and correlations with behavior, similarly to univariate approaches, with potentially greater statistical power and better reproducibility checks. In contrast to these advantages is the high barrier of entry to the use of multivariate approaches, preventing more widespread application in the community. To the neuroscientist becoming familiar with multivariate analysis techniques, an initial survey of the field might present a bewildering variety of approaches that, although algorithmically similar, are presented with different emphases, typically by people with mathematics backgrounds. We believe that multivariate analysis techniques have sufficient potential to warrant better dissemination. Researchers should be able to employ them in an informed and accessible manner.

	abstract = {The growing number of modalities (e.g. multi-omics, imaging and clinical data) characterizing a given disease provides physicians and statisticians with complementary facets reflecting the disease process but emphasizes the need for novel statistical methods of data analysis able to unify these views. Such data sets are indeed intrinsically structured in blocks, where each block represents a set of variables observed on a group of individuals. Therefore, classical statistical tools cannot be applied without altering their organization, with the risk of information loss. Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) and its sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) counterpart are component-based methods for exploratory analyses of data sets structured in blocks of variables. Rather than operating sequentially on parts of the measurements, the RGCCA/SGCCA-based integrative analysis method aims at summarizing the relevant information between and within the blocks. It processes a priori information defining which blocks are supposed to be linked to one another, thus reflecting hypotheses about the biology underlying the data blocks. It also requires the setting of extra parameters that need to be carefully adjusted. Here, we provide practical guidelines for the use of RGCCA/SGCCA. We also illustrate the flexibility and usefulness of RGCCA/SGCCA on a unique cohort of patients with four genetic subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia, in which we obtained multiple data sets from brain volumetry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and metabolomic and lipidomic analyses. As a first step toward the extraction of multimodal biomarkers, and through the reduction to a few meaningful components and the visualization of relevant variables, we identified possible markers of disease progression.},

A principal advantage of this approach is its applicability to cognitive paradigms for which detailed models of brain activity are not available. Independent component analysis has been successfully utilized to analyze single-subject fMRI data sets, and an extension of this work would be to provide for group inferences. However, unlike univariate methods (e.g., regression analysis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics), ICA does not naturally generalize to a method suitable for drawing inferences about groups of subjects. We introduce a novel approach for drawing group inferences using ICA of fMRI data, and present its application to a simple visual paradigm that alternately stimulates the left or right visual field. Our group ICA analysis revealed task-related components in left and right visual cortex, a transiently task-related component in bilateral occipital/parietal cortex, and a non-task-related component in bilateral visual association cortex. We address issues involved in the use of ICA as an fMRI analysis method such as: (1) How many components should be calculated? (2) How are these components to be combined across subjects? (3) How should the final results be thresholded and/or presented?

	abstract = {Background: Heterogeneity of histopathology across hippocampal sub fields has been reported in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, subfield-specific neu roimaging biomarkers could provide greater sensitivity over whole hippocampus volume measurements. An analysis of subfield level hippocampal volume atrophy in a small group of subjects is presented here. Sub field volumes are measured from in vivo images using normalization to a high resolution postmortem atlas. Methods: The data set consists of T1-weighted 3T MRI scans of 27 subjects - 11 controls and 16 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - at multiple time points, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Each subject's hippocampi are segmented from the baseline scan using a semi-automated protocol. Sub fields are labeled in each baseline scan using shape-based normalization to the postmortem atlas (Figure 1) containing subfield labels (Yushkevich et al., Neuroimage 44:2,385-398). Followup images are mapped to the baseline image using high-dimensional normalization, thus providing an estimate of the longitudinal volume change. Finally, subfield-specific atrophy rates are obtained by integrating the Jacobian of this intra-subject transformation over each subfield. Results: Longitudinal atrophy is observed throughout the hippocampus, but greater on average in MCI than the control group. CA1 has significantly higher atrophy in MCI compared to controls (p=0.02). The subfield label comprising stratum radiatum, stratum lacuno-sum-moleculare and vestigial hippocampal sulcus trends towards higher at rophy in MCI as well (p=0.09). Atrophy in CA2/3 (p=0.43) and DG (p=0.67) do not differ significantly between the two groups. However, within the MCI group, subjects with ApoE4/E4 genotype (6 subjects) have significantly higher (p=0.04) atrophy in CA2/3 than those with ApoE3/E3 (7 subjects) (Figure 2). Conclusions: Higher CA1 atrophy in MCI compared to controls and relative sparing of CA2/3 and DG have been reported by other researchers (Qiu et al., Neuroimage 40:1, 68-76; Apostolova et al., Arch. Neurol. 63:5, 693-699.). On the other hand, Mueller et al. found greater CA3 atrophy in subjects with ApoE4 genotype (Mueller et al., Neuroimage 42:1, 42-48). Our preliminary analysis replicates both of these results. This indicates that atlas-based subfield labeling techniques can potentially be used in clinical studies. However, the data set used is small and further val idation in a larger data set is required},

Decades of work in the fields of sociology, education, and public health have demonstrated strong links between socioeconomic status (SES) and important measures of child development, such as IQ, grade retention, and school graduation rates. Such measures tell us in broad strokes that socioeconomic differences in childhood are linked to large differences in cognitive development and academic achievement. The emerging understanding of the which, when and how of poverty's effects on brain development can also encourage societal investment in child development by making clear the physical consequences of socioeconomic status on human capital. By placing the problem of child poverty and cognitive development in a biological framework, this issue highlights the public health aspect of a problem that has heretofore been viewed only in terms of social justice. The current vital state of SES research in neuroscience is a welcome development, which contrasts sharply with the skeptical, if not hostile, reception such work received less than a decade ago.

	abstract = {In psychology, attempts to replicate published findings are less successful than expected. For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80\%, whereas in practice less than 40\% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor classification is inexact and largely dependent on the qualitative pathological examination of the images of the tumor tissue slides. In this study, our aim was to develop an automated computational method to classify Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) stained tissue sections based on cancer tissue texture features. METHODS: Image processing of histology slide images was used to detect and identify adipose tissue, extracellular matrix, morphologically distinct cell nuclei types, and the tubular architecture. The texture parameters derived from image analysis were then applied to classify images in a supervised classification scheme using histologic grade of a testing set as guidance. RESULTS: The histologic grade assigned by pathologists to invasive breast carcinoma images strongly correlated with both the presence and extent of cell nuclei with dispersed chromatin and the architecture, specifically the extent of presence of tubular cross sections. The two parameters that differentiated tumor grade found in this study were (1) the number density of cell nuclei with dispersed chromatin and (2) the number density of tubular cross sections identified through image processing as white blobs that were surrounded by a continuous string of cell nuclei. Classification based on subdivisions of a whole slide image containing a high concentration of cancer cell nuclei consistently agreed with the grade classification of the entire slide. CONCLUSION: The automated image analysis and classification presented in this study demonstrate the feasibility of developing clinically relevant classification of histology images based on micro- texture. This method provides pathologists an invaluable quantitative tool for evaluation of the components of the Nottingham system for breast tumor grading and avoid intra-observer variability thus increasing the consistency of the decision-making process.},

Each affine transform is defined on a local region and the resulting diffeomorphism encapsulates all the local transforms by a smooth and invertible displacement field. Compared with traditional weighting schemes used in combining local transforms, our new scheme guarantees that the resulting transform precisely preserves the value of each local affine transform. By introducing the trajectory of local regions instead of using regions themselves, the new approach encodes precisely each local affine transform using a diffeomorphism with one or more stationary velocity fields. Experiments show that our new polyaffine model is both accurate and efficient. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Both measures provide results that closely approximate normal physiological behavior, as judged from the original data.

	abstract = {Motivation: Cis-acting regulatory elements are frequently constrained by both sequence content and positioning relative to a functional site, such as a splice or polyadenylation site. We describe an approach to regulatory motif analysis based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Whereas existing pattern recognition algorithms commonly focus primarily on sequence content, our method simultaneously characterizes both positioning and sequence content of putative motifs. Results: Tests on artificially generated sequences show that NMF can faithfully reproduce both positioning and content of test motifs. We show how the variation of the residual sum of squares can be used to give a robust estimate of the number of motifs or patterns in a sequence set. Our analysis distinguishes multiple motifs with significant overlap in sequence content and/or positioning. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the NMF approach through characterization of biologically interesting datasets. Specifically, an analysis of mRNA 3′-processing (cleavage and polyadenylation) sites from a broad range of higher eukaryotes reveals a conserved core pattern of three elements. © 2008 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Nonlinear registration of individual brain MRI scans to standard brain templates is common practice in neuroimaging and multiple registration algorithms have been developed and refined over the last 20 years. However, little has been done to quantitatively compare the available algorithms and much of that work has exclusively focused on cortical structures given their importance in the fMRI literature. In contrast, for clinical applications such as functional neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS), proper alignment of subcortical structures between template and individual space is important. This allows for atlas-based segmentations of anatomical DBS targets such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal pallidum (GPi). Here, we systematically evaluated the performance of six modern and established algorithms on subcortical normalization and segmentation results by calculating over 11,000 nonlinear warps in over 100 subjects. For each algorithm, we evaluated its performance using T1-or T2-weighted acquisitions alone or a combination of T1-, T2-and PD-weighted acquisitions in parallel. Furthermore, we present optimized parameters for the best performing algorithms. We tested each algorithm on two datasets, a state-of-the-art MRI cohort of young subjects and a cohort of subjects age- and MR-quality-matched to a typical DBS Parkinson's Disease cohort. Our final pipeline is able to segment DBS targets with precision comparable to manual expert segmentations in both cohorts. Although the present study focuses on the two prominent DBS targets, STN and GPi, these methods may extend to other small subcortical structures like thalamic nuclei or the nucleus accumbens.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging data embodies a massive multiple testing problem, where 100,000 correlated test statistics must be assessed. The familywise error rate, the chance of any false positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

	issn = {15491277},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.0040230},
	abstract = {Background: RPE65 is an essential molecule in the retinoid-visual cycle, and RPE65 gene mutations cause the congenital human blindness known as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Somatic gene therapy delivered to the retina of blind dogs with an RPE65 mutation dramatically restores retinal physiology and has sparked international interest in human treatment trials for this incurable disease. An unanswered question is how the visual cortex responds after prolonged sensory deprivation from retinal dysfunction. We therefore studied the cortex of RPE65-mutant dogs before and after retinal gene therapy. Then, we inquired whether there is visual pathway integrity and responsivity in adult humans with LCA due to RPE65 mutations (RPE65-LCA). Methods and Findings: RPE65-mutant dogs were studied with fMRI. Prior to therapy, retinal and subcortical responses to light were markedly diminished, and there were minimal cortical responses within the primary visual areas of the lateral gyrus (activation amplitude mean ± standard deviation [SD] = 0.07\% ± 0.06\% and volume = 1.3 ± 0.6 cm3). Following therapy, retinal and subcortical response restoration was accompanied by increased amplitude (0.18\% ± 0.06\%) and volume (8.2 ± 0.8 cm3) of activation within the lateral gyrus (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.005 for both). Cortical recovery occurred rapidly (within a month of treatment) and was persistent (as long as 2.5 y after treatment). Recovery was present even when treatment was provided as late as 1-4 y of age. Human RPE65-LCA patients (ages 18-23 y) were studied with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Optic nerve diameter (3.2 ± 0.5 mm) was within the normal range (3.2 ± 0.3 mm), and occipital cortical white matter density as judged by voxel-based morphometry was slightly but significantly altered (1.3 SD below control average, p = 0.005). Functional magnetic resonance imaging in human RPE65-LCA patients revealed cortical responses with a markedly diminished activation volume (8.8 ± 1.2 cm 3) compared to controls (29.7 ± 8.3 cm3, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) when stimulated with lower intensity light. Unexpectedly, cortical response volume (41.2 ± 11.1 cm3) was comparable to normal (48.8 ± 3.1 cm3, p = 0.2) with higher intensity light stimulation. Conclusions: Visual cortical responses dramatically improve after retinal gene therapy in the canine model of RPE65-LCA. Human RPE65-LCA patients have preserved visual pathway anatomy and detectable cortical activation despite limited visual experience. Taken together, the results support the potential for human visual benefit from retinal therapies currently being aimed at restoring vision to the congenitally blind with genetic retinal disease. © 2007 Aguirre et al.},

In this study, for the first time, we examined regional and lateralized cortical thickness in a sample of 71 chimpanzees for comparison with previously reported findings in humans. We also measured gray and white matter volumes for each subject. The results indicated that chimpanzees showed significant regional variation in cortical thickness with lower values in primary motor and sensory cortex compared with association cortex. Furthermore, chimpanzees showed significant rightward asymmetries in cortical thickness for a number of regions of interest throughout the cortex and leftward asymmetries in white but not gray matter volume. We also found that total and region-specific cortical thickness was significantly negatively correlated with white matter volume. Thus, chimpanzees with greater white matter volumes had thinner cortical thickness. The collective findings are discussed within the context of previous findings in humans and theories on the evolution of cortical organization and lateralization in primates. © 2013 the authors.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.09.005},
	abstract = {Quantifiers are very common in everyday speech, but we know little about their cognitive basis or neural representation. The present study examined comprehension of three classes of quantifiers that depend on different cognitive components in patients with focal neurodegenerative diseases. Patients evaluated the truth-value of a sentence containing a quantifier relative to a picture illustrating a small number of familiar objects, and performance was related to MRI grey matter atrophy using voxel-based morphometry. We found that patients with corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) are significantly impaired in their comprehension of cardinal quantifiers (e.g. " At least three birds are on the branch" ), due in part to their deficit in quantity knowledge. MRI analyses related this deficit to temporal-parietal atrophy found in CBS/PCA. We also found that patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are significantly impaired in their comprehension of logical quantifiers (e.g. " Some of the birds are on the branch" ), associated with a simple form of perceptual logic, and this correlated with their deficit on executive measures. This deficit was related to disease in rostral prefrontal cortex in bvFTD. These patients were also impaired in their comprehension of majority quantifiers (e.g. " At least half of the birds are on the branch" ), and this too was correlated with their deficit on executive measures. This was related to disease in the basal ganglia interrupting a frontal-striatal loop critical for executive functioning. These findings suggest that a large-scale frontal-parietal neural network plays a crucial role in quantifier comprehension, and that comprehension of specific classes of quantifiers may be selectively impaired in patients with focal neurodegenerative conditions in these areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine the frequency and stability over time of the subgroup characterization of the tremor dominant (TD) versus postural instability gait disorder dominant (PIGD) Parkinson's disease (PD) in de novo patients. Background: There is a substantial body of literature on the clinical sub classification of PD into TD versus PIGD subtype. However, there are limited data on the stability of this classification especially in early disease. Methods: Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is a longitudinal case control study of de novo, untreated PD participants at enrollment. Participants undergo a number of assessments including the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). TD versus PIGD subtype was defined based on the previously published formula. We report one-year analysis data. Results: 320 of 423 PD recruited subjects had data on subtype classification at year 1 and were included in the analysis. 228 (71\%) were classified as TD, 56 (18\%) as PIGD and 36 (11\%) as indeterminate at baseline. At 12 months, 39\% PIGD and 18\% TD shifted subtypes: 29\% PIGD shifted to TD and 11\% to Indeterminate; 10\% TD shifted to PIGD and 8\% to Indeterminate. The classification was not affected by the dopaminergic treatment (p = 0.59). Conclusions: TD versus PIGD subtype classification has substantial variability over first year in PD de novo cohort specifically for PIGD subtype. Dopaminergic therapy does not impact the change of the PD subtype. This instability has to be taken into consideration specifically when establishing correlations with the biomarkers and for long term prognostication.},

	abstract = {Cross-sectional comparisons have consistently revealed that increased age is associated with lower levels of cognitive performance, even in the range from 18 to 60 years of age. However, the validity of cross-sectional comparisons of cognitive functioning in young and middle-aged adults has been questioned because of the discrepant age trends found in longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses. The results of the current project suggest that a major factor contributing to the discrepancy is the masking of age-related declines in longitudinal comparisons by large positive effects associated with prior test experience. Results from three methods of estimating retest effects in this project, together with results from studies comparing non-human animals raised in constant environments and from studies examining neurobiological variables not susceptible to retest effects, converge on a conclusion that some aspects of age-related cognitive decline begin in healthy educated adults when they are in their 20s and 30s. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {‘Big data' is massive amounts of information that can work wonders. It has become a topic of special interest for the past two decades because of a great potential that is hidden in it. Various public and private sector industries generate, store, and analyze big data with an aim to improve the services they provide. In the healthcare industry, various sources for big data include hospital records, medical records of patients, results of medical examinations, and devices that are a part of internet of things. Biomedical research also generates a significant portion of big data relevant to public healthcare. This data requires proper management and analysis in order to derive meaningful information. Otherwise, seeking solution by analyzing big data quickly becomes comparable to finding a needle in the haystack. There are various challenges associated with each step of handling big data which can only be surpassed by using high-end computing solutions for big data analysis. That is why, to provide relevant solutions for improving public health, healthcare providers are required to be fully equipped with appropriate infrastructure to systematically generate and analyze big data. An efficient management, analysis, and interpretation of big data can change the game by opening new avenues for modern healthcare. That is exactly why various industries, including the healthcare industry, are taking vigorous steps to convert this potential into better services and financial advantages. With a strong integration of biomedical and healthcare data, modern healthcare organizations can possibly revolutionize the medical therapies and personalized medicine.},

The image is treated as a graph from which the user selects seed points to be connected via 1-dimensional paths. A variant of Dijkstra's algorithm both grows the segmenting surface from initial seeds and connects them with a minimal path computation. The technique is local and does not require examination or pre-processing of the entire volume. The surface propagation is controlled by iterative computation of border probabilities. As expanding regions meet, the statistics collected during propagation are passed to an active minimal-path generation module which links the associating points through the vessel tree. We provide a probabilistic basis for the volume search and path- finding speed functions and then apply the algorithm to phantom and real data sets.

Our main objective was to determine the correspondence between changes in the substantia nigra, evident in neuromelanin and iron sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dopaminergic striatal innervation loss in patients with PD. Eighteen patients and 18 healthy control subjects were included in the study. Using neuromelanin-MRI, we measured the volume of the substantia nigra and the contrast-to-noise-ratio between substantia nigra and a background region. The apparent transverse relaxation rate and magnetic susceptibility of the substantia nigra were calculated from dual-echo MRI. Striatal dopaminergic innervation was measured as density of dopamine transporter (DAT) by means of single-photon emission computed tomography and [123I] N-ømega-fluoropropyl-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-iodophenyl) tropane. Patients showed a reduced volume of the substantia nigra and contrast-to-noise-ratio and both positively correlated with the corresponding striatal DAT density. The apparent transverse relaxation rate and magnetic susceptibility values of the substantia nigra did not differ between patients and healthy controls. The best predictor of DAT reduction was the volume of the substantia nigra. Clinical and imaging correlations were also investigated for the locus coeruleus. Our results suggest that neuromelanin-MRI can be used for quantifying substantia nigra pathology in PD where it closely correlates with dopaminergic striatal innervation loss. Longitudinal studies should further explore the role of Neuromelanin-MRI as an imaging biomarker of PD, especially for subjects at risk of developing the disease.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the cognitive and neural basis for nonfluent speech in progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). Background: Nonfluent speech is the hallmark feature of PNFA, and this has been attributed to impairments in syntactic processing, motor-speech planning, and executive functioning that also occur in these patients. Patients with PNFA have left inferior frontal atrophy. Methods: A large semi-structured speech sample and neuropsychological measures of language and executive functioning were examined in 16 patients with PNFA, 12 patients with behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and 13 age-matched controls. Speech fluency was quantified as words per minute (WPM) in the semi-structured speech sample. Stepwise linear regression analyses were used to relate WPM to grammatic, motor-speech planning, and executive aspects of patient functioning. These measures were then related to cortical thickness in 8 patients with PNFA and 7 patients with bvFTD using structural MRI. Results: WPM was significantly reduced in patients with PNFA relative to controls and patients with bvFTD. Regression analyses revealed that only grammatic measures predicted WPM in PNFA, whereas executive measures were the only significant predictor of WPM in bvFTD. Cortical thinning was significant in PNFA relative to controls in left inferior frontal and anterior-superior temporal regions, and a regression analysis related this area to reduced WPM in PNFA. Significant cortical thinning associated with limited grammatic processing also was seen in the left inferior frontal-superior temporal region in PNFA, and this overlapped with the area of frontal-temporal thinning related to reduced WPM. Conclusion: Nonfluent speech in PNFA may be due in part to difficulty with grammatic processing associated with left inferior frontal and anterior-superior temporal disease.

	abstract = {Non-invasive measurement of resting state cerebral blood flow (CBF) may reflect alterations of brain structure and function after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, previous imaging studies of resting state brain in chronic TBI have been limited by several factors, including measurement in relative rather than absolute units, use of crude spatial registration methods, exclusion of subjects with substantial focal lesions, and exposure to ionizing radiation, which limits repeated assessments. This study aimed to overcome those obstacles by measuring absolute CBF with an arterial spin labeling perfusion fMRI technique, and using an image preprocessing protocol that is optimized for brains with mixed diffuse and focal injuries characteristic of moderate and severe TBI. Resting state CBF was quantified in 27 individuals with moderate to severe TBI in the chronic stage, and 22 demographically matched healthy controls. In addition to global CBF reductions in the TBI subjects, more prominent regional hypoperfusion was found in the posterior cingulate cortices, the thalami, and multiple locations in the frontal cortices. Diffuse injury, as assessed by tensor-based morphometry, was mainly associated with reduced CBF in the posterior cingulate cortices and the thalami, where the greatest volume losses were detected. Hypoperfusion in superior and middle frontal cortices, in contrast, was associated with focal lesions. These results suggest that structural lesions, both focal and diffuse, are the main contributors to the absolute CBF alterations seen in chronic TBI, and that CBF may serve as a tool to assess functioning neuronal volume. We also speculate that resting reductions in posterior cingulate perfusion may reflect alterations in the default-mode network, and may contribute to the attentional deficits common in TBI.

Using multi-atlas segmentation and machine learning-based correction, we were able to produce automated amygdala segments with high Dice (Mean=0.918 for the left amygdala; 0.916 for the right amygdala) and Jaccard coefficients (Mean=0.850 for the left; 0.846 for the right) compared to rigorously hand-traced volumes. This automated routine also produced amygdala segments with high intra-class correlations (consistency=0.830, absolute agreement=0.819 for the left; consistency=0.786, absolute agreement=0.783 for the right) and bivariate (r =0.831 for the left; r =0.797 for the right) compared to handdrawn amygdala. Our results are discussed in relation to other cutting-edge segmentation techniques, as well as commonly available approaches to amygdala segmentation (e.g., Freesurfer).

We apply this algorithm to estimating a putative evolutionary change of coordinates between a population of chimpanzee and human cortices. Inter-species functional homologues fix the map explicitly, where they are known, while image similarities guide the alignment elsewhere.

	abstract = {Introduction: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) present a variety of non-motor symptoms. However, it remains unclear whether dopamine depletion is related to non-motor symptoms, and which non-motor symptoms are significantly dependent on dopaminergic deficit. Methods: Forty-one patients with PD who underwent positron emission tomography imaging of dopamine transporters (DATs) were recruited for this study. The striatum was divided into 12 subregions, and DAT activity, as striatal dopaminergic concentration, was calculated in each subregion. In addition to measuring motor symptoms using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-part III (UPDRS-III), various non-motor symptoms were assessed using the Montreal cognitive assessment, frontal assessment battery, Beck depression inventory (BDI), Beck anxiety inventory, PD sleep scale (PDSS), PD fatigue scale, and non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) for PD. Results: For simple linear regression analyses, dopaminergic depletion in all striatal subregions was negatively correlated with the UPDRS-III score. The most relevant non-motor symptom assessment related to dopaminergic loss in the 12 subregions was NMSS, followed by BDI and PDSS. However, following multiple linear regression analyses, dopaminergic depletion in the 12 striatal subregions was not related with any of the non-motor symptoms. Conversely, dopaminergic deficit in the right anterior and posterior putamen was associated with the UPDRS-III score. Conclusions: Striatal dopaminergic depletion was not significantly correlated with any of the various non-motor symptoms in PD. Our findings suggest that non-dopaminergic systems are significantly implicated in the pathogenesis of non-motor symptoms in patients with PD.},

	abstract = {Current research investigating the modeling of left ventricular dynamics for accurate clinical assessment of cardiac function is extensive. Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is a functional imaging method which allows for encoding of a grid of signal voids on cardiac MR images, providing a mechanism for noninvasive measurement of intramural tissue deformations, in vivo. We present a novel technique of employing a four-dimensional (4-D) B-spline model which permits concurrent determination of myocardial beads and myocardial strains. The method entails fitting the knot planes of the 4-D B-spline model for fixed times to a sequence of triplets of orthogonal sets of tag surfaces for all imaged volumetric frames within the constraints of the model's spatio-temporal internal energy. From a three-dimensional (3-D) displacement field, the corresponding long and short-axis Lagrangian normal, shear, and principal strain maps are produced. As an important byproduct, the points defined by the 3-D intersections of the triplets of orthogonal tag planes, which we refer to as myocardial beads, can easily be determined by our model. Displaying the beads as a movie loop allows for the visualization of the nonrigid movement of the left ventricle in 3-D.},

	abstract = {Many real-world applications propose the request for sharing knowledge among different tasks or datasets. Transfer learning has been proposed to solve this kind of problems and it has been successfully applied in supervised learning and semi-supervised learning settings. However, its adoption in clustering, one of the most classical research problems in machine learning and data mining, is still scarce. Spectral clustering, as a major clustering algorithm with wide applications and better performance than k-means typically, has not been well incorporated with knowledge transfer. In this paper, we first consider the problem of learning from only one auxiliary unlabeled dataset for spectral clustering and propose a novel algorithm called transfer spectral clustering (TSC). Then, it is extended to the settings with multiple auxiliary tasks. TSC assumes the feature embeddings being shared with the auxiliary tasks and utilizes co-clustering to extract useful information from the auxiliary datasets to improve the clustering performance. TSC involves not only the data manifold information of individual task but also the feature manifold information shared between related tasks. An in-depth explanation of our algorithm together with a convergence analysis are provided. As demonstrated by the extensive experiments, TSC can effectively improve the clustering performance by using auxiliary unlabeled data when compared with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.},

Standard voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyzes imaging data voxel-by-voxel—and follows this with cluster-based or voxel-wise multiple comparisons correction methods to determine significance. Eigenanatomy reverses the standard order of operations by first clustering the voxel data and then using standard linear regression in this reduced dimensionality space. As with traditional region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, this strategy can greatly improve detection power. Our results show that eigenanatomy provides a principled objective function that leads to localized, data-driven regions of interest. These regions improve our ability to quantify biologically plausible rates of cortical change in two distinct forms of neurodegeneration.

To investigate whether these deficits are coupled with atrophy of memory-related brain regions, T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired and volumes of the cerebrum, ventricles, prefrontal cortex (PFC), calcarine cortex, hippocampus, and striatum were quantified in young and aged rhesus monkeys. Subjects were tested on a spatiotemporal memory procedure (delayed response [DR]) that requires the integrity of the PFC and a medial temporal lobe-dependent recognition memory task (delayed nonmatching to sample [DNMS]). Region of interest analyses revealed that age inversely correlated with striatal, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex volumes. Hippocampal volume predicted acquisition of the DR task. Striatal volume correlated with DNMS acquisition, whereas total prefrontal gray matter, prefrontal white matter, and dlPFC volumes each predicted DNMS accuracy. A regional covariance analysis revealed that age-related volumetric changes could be captured in a distributed network that was coupled with declining performance across delays on the DNMS task. This volumetric analysis adds to growing evidence that cognitive aging in primates arises from region-specific morphometric alterations distributed across multiple memory-related brain systems, including subdivisions of the PFC.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing effort to analyze the morphometry of hippocampal subfields using both in vivo and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, given that boundaries between subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) are conventionally defined on the basis of microscopic features that often lack discernible signature in MRI, subfield delineation in MRI literature has largely relied on heuristic geometric rules, the validity of which with respect to the underlying anatomy is largely unknown. The development and evaluation of such rules are challenged by the limited availability of data linking MRI appearance to microscopic hippocampal anatomy, particularly in three dimensions (3D). The present paper, for the first time, demonstrates the feasibility of labeling hippocampal subfields in a high resolution volumetric MRI dataset based directly on microscopic features extracted from histology. It uses a combination of computational techniques and manual post-processing to map subfield boundaries from a stack of histology images (obtained with 200. μm spacing and 5. μm slice thickness; stained using the Kluver-Barrera method) onto a postmortem 9.4. Tesla MRI scan of the intact, whole hippocampal formation acquired with 160. μm isotropic resolution. The histology reconstruction procedure consists of sequential application of a graph-theoretic slice stacking algorithm that mitigates the effects of distorted slices, followed by iterative affine and diffeomorphic co-registration to postmortem MRI scans of approximately 1. cm-thick tissue sub-blocks acquired with 200. μm isotropic resolution. These 1. cm blocks are subsequently co-registered to the MRI of the whole HF. Reconstruction accuracy is evaluated as the average displacement error between boundaries manually delineated in both the histology and MRI following the sequential stages of reconstruction. The methods presented and evaluated in this single-subject study can potentially be applied to multiple hippocampal tissue samples in order to construct a histologically informed MRI atlas of the hippocampal formation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

First, as MLSCA solutions are fitted by means of iterative algorithms, analyzing large data sets (i.e., data sets with many level one units) may take a lot of computation time. Second, easily accessible software for estimating MLSCA models is lacking so far. In this paper, we address both issues. Specifically, we discuss a computational shortcut for MLSCA fitting. Moreover, we present the MLSCA package, which was built in MATLAB, but is also available in a version that can be used on any Windows computer, without having MATLAB installed.},

	abstract = {Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) are commonly used to quantify tracer uptake in amyloid beta positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET).

Methods: Florbetapir PET SUVR was calculated at baseline (screening) and Weeks 26 and 54 for patients randomized to placebo and each of four aducanumab doses (1, 3, 6, and 10 mg/kg), using whole cerebellum, cerebellar grey matter, cerebellar white matter, pons, and subcortical white matter as reference regions. In addition to the pre-specified composite cortex target ROI, individual cerebral cortical ROIs were assessed as targets. Results: Of the reference regions used, subcortical white matter, cerebellum white matter, or pons, alone or in combination, generated the largest effect sizes. The use of anterior cingulate cortex as target ROI resulted in greater effect sizes than composite cortex. SUVR calculations were not affected by correction for brain volume change over time. Conclusion: Dose- and time-dependent reductions in amyloid PET SUVR were consistently observed with aducanumab only in cortical regions prone to amyloid plaque deposition, regardless of amyloid-plaque-devoid reference region used. These data support the hypothesis that florbetapir SUVR responses associated with aducanumab treatment are a result of specific dose- and time-dependent reductions in amyloid burden in patients with AD.},

	abstract = {Spatial normalization of diffusion tensor images plays a key role in voxel-based analysis of white matter (WM) group differences. Currently, it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three normalization methods representing the current range of available approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy (FA), high-dimensional normalization using the FA, and high-dimensional normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the alignment of WM tracts. © 2007 IEEE.},

Image registration is a key technology in medical image analysis. Our algorithm uses a partial differential equation constrained optimal control formulation. Finding the optimal deformation map requires the solution of a highly nonlinear problem that involves pseudo-differential operators, biharmonic operators, and pure advection operators both forward and backward in time. A key issue is the time to solution, which poses the demand for efficient optimization methods as well as an effective utilization of high performance computing resources. To address this problem we use a preconditioned, inexact, Gauss-Newton-Krylov solver. Our algorithm integrates several components: A spectral discretization in space, a semi-Lagrangian formulation in time, analytic adjoints, different regularization functionals (including volume-preserving ones), a spectral preconditioner, a highly optimized distributed Fast Fourier Transform, and a cubic interpolation scheme for the semi-Lagrangian time-stepping. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm on images with resolution of up to 10243 on the 'Maverick' and 'Stampede' systems at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). The critical problem in the medical imaging application domain is strong scaling, that is, solving registration problems of a moderate size of 2563- A typical resolution for medical images. We are able to solve the registration problem for images of this size in less than five seconds on 64 x86 nodes of TACC's 'Maverick' system.},

We aimed to assess the ability of various quantitative measures of brain cortical folding on MR imaging in determining fetal gestational age in the third trimester. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 8 different quantitative cortical folding measures to predict gestational age i n 33 healthy fetuses by using T2-weighted fetal MR imaging. We compared the accuracy of the prediction of gestational age by these cortical folding measures with the accuracy of prediction by brain volume measurement and by a previously reported semiquantitative visual scale of brain maturity. Regression models were constructed, and measurement biases and variances were determined via a cross-validation procedure. RESULTS: The cortical folding measures are accurate in the estimation and prediction of gestational age (mean of the absolute error, 0.43 ± 0.45 weeks) and perform better than (P = .024) brain volume (mean of the absolute error, 0.72 ± 0.61 weeks) or sonography measures (SDs approximately 1.5 weeks, as reported in literature). Prediction accuracy is comparable with that of the semiquantitative visual assessment score (mean, 0.57 ± 0.41 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative cortical folding measures such as global average curvedness can be an accurate and reliable estimator of gestational age and brain maturity for healthy fetuses in the third trimester and have the potential to be an indicator of brain-growth delays for at-risk fetuses and preterm neonates.},

	title = {Machine learning and radiology},
	abstract = {In this paper, we give a short introduction to machine learning and survey its applications in radiology. We focused on six categories of applications in radiology: medical image segmentation, registration, computer aided detection and diagnosis, brain function or activity analysis and neurological disease diagnosis from fMR images, content-based image retrieval systems for CT or MRI images, and text analysis of radiology reports using natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU). This survey shows that machine learning plays a key role in many radiology applications. Machine learning identifies complex patterns automatically and helps radiologists make intelligent decisions on radiology data such as conventional radiographs, CT, MRI, and PET images and radiology reports. In many applications, the performance of machine learning-based automatic detection and diagnosis systems has shown to be comparable to that of a well-trained and experienced radiologist. Technology development in machine learning and radiology will benefit from each other in the long run. Key contributions and common characteristics of machine learning techniques in radiology are discussed. We also discuss the problem of translating machine learning applications to the radiology clinical setting, including advantages and potential barriers. ?? 2012 .},

	abstract = {Objective: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is associated with impaired executive control. The aim of the current research was to test the hypothesis that concept formation deficits associated with an extramotor neurocognitive network involving executive and semantic resources can be found in some ALS patients. Method: Forty-one patients with clinically definite ALS were assessed with Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Sorting Test (D-KEFS), a measure of concept formation requiring patients to manipulate verbal and visual semantic information and neuropsychological tests measuring naming, semantic memory, and executive control. Using D-KEFS scale scores, a k-mean cluster analysis specifying a 3-group solution was able to classify ALS patients into groups presenting with mildly impaired, average, and above average sorting test performance. High-resolution T1 structural MRI was used to examine cortical thickness in a subset of 16 ALS patients. Results: Stepwise regression analyses related free and recognition sorting test performance to measures of action naming, single word semantic knowledge, and mental search/working memory. MRI studies found widespread cortical thinning involving bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Regression analyses related recognition sorting performance to reduced MRI cortical thickness involving the left prefrontal and left parietal cortex. Conclusions: An extramotor cognitive network is associated with impaired concept formation in ALS. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {This work provides a new technique for surface oriented volumetric image analysis. The method makes no assumptions about topology, instead constructing a local neighborhood from image information, such as a segmentation or edge map, to define a surface patch. Neighborhood constructions using extrinsic and intrinsic distances are given. This representation allows one to estimate differential properties directly from the image's Gauss map. We develop a novel technique for this purpose which estimates the shape operator and yields both principal directions and curvatures. Only first derivatives need be estimated, making the method numerically stable. We show the use of these measures for multi-scale classification of image structure by the mean and Gaussian curvatures. Finally, we propose to register image volumes by surface curvature. This is particularly useful when geometry is the only variable. To illustrate this, we register binary segmented data by surface curvature, both rigidly and non-rigidly. A novel variant of Demons registration, extensible for use with differentiable similarity metrics, is also applied for deformable curvature-driven registration of medical images. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

We incorporate an accessible approach for simultaneously scanning multiple ex vivo brains, requiring only a 3D-printed brain holder, and novel image processing steps for their separation and orientation. We employ clinically established multi-atlas techniques-superior to single-atlas methods-together with publicly-available atlas databases for automatic skull-stripping and tissue segmentation, providing high-quality, subject-specific tissue maps. We follow these steps with group-wise registration, structural parcellation and both Voxel- and Tensor-Based Morphometry-advanta-geous for their ability to highlight morphological differences without the laborious delineation of regions of interest. We show the application of freely available open-source software developed for clinical MRI analysis to mouse brain data: NiftySeg for segmentation and NiftyReg for registration, and discuss atlases and parameters suitable for the preclinical paradigm. We used this pipeline to compare 29 Tc1 brains with 26 wild-type littermate controls, imaged ex vivo at 9.4T. We show an unexpected increase in Tc1 total intracranial volume and, controlling for this, local volume and grey matter density reductions in the Tc1 brain compared to the wild-types, most prominently in the cerebellum, in agreement with human DS and previous histological findings.},

High-throughput methods permit genome-wide searches to discover genes that are uniquely expressed In brain circuits and regions that control behavior. Previous gene expression mapping studies in model organisms have employed In situ hybridization (ISH), a technique that uses labeled nucleic acid probes to bind to specific mRNA transcripts In tissue sections. A key requirement for this effort is the development of fast and robust algorithms for anatomically mapping and quantifying gene expression for ISH. We describe a neuroinformatics pipeline for automatically mapping expression profiles of ISH data and Its use to produce the first genomic scale 3D mapping of gene expression In a mammalian brain.

Implementing these large-p-with-small-n regressions poses several statistical and computational challenges, some of which can be confronted using Bayesian methods. This approach allows integrating various parametric and nonparametric shrinkage and variable selection procedures in a unified and consistent manner. The BGLR R-package implements a large collection of Bayesian regression models, including parametric variable selection and shrinkage methods and semiparametric procedures (Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regressions, RKHS). The software was originally developed for genomic applications; however, the methods implemented are useful for many nongenomic applications as well. The response can be continuous (censored or not) or categorical (either binary or ordinal). The algorithm is based on a Gibbs sampler with scalar updates and the implementation takes advantage of efficient compiled C and Fortran routines. In this article we describe the methods implemented in BGLR, present examples of the use of the package, and discuss practical issues emerging in real-data analysis.},

Even using histological techniques it is difficult to delineate with certainty from surrounding structures. We sought to define the anatomy of the SN using high field spin-echo MRI of pathological material in which we could study the anatomy in detail to corroborate our MRI findings in controls and Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Methods 23 brains were selected from the Queen Square Brain Bank (10 controls, 8 progressive supranuclear palsy, 5 Parkinson's disease) and imaged using high field 9.4 Tesla spin-echo MRI. Subsequently brains were cut and stained with Luxol fast blue, Perls stain, and immunohistochemistry for substance P and calbindin. Once the anatomy was defined on histology the dimensions and volume of the substantia nigra were determined on high field magnetic resonance images. Results The anterior border of the substantia nigra was defined by the crus cerebri. In the medial half it was less distinct due to the deposition of iron and the interdigitation of white matter and the substantia nigra. The posterior border was flanked by white matter bridging the red nucleus and substantia nigra and seen as hypointense on spin-echo magnetic resonance images. Within the substantia nigra high signal structures corresponded to confirmed nigrosomes. These were still evident in Parkinson's disease but not in progressive supranuclear palsy. The volume and dimensions of the substantia nigra were similar in Parkinson's disease and controls, but reduced in progressive supranuclear palsy. Conclusions We present a histologically validated anatomical description of the substantia nigra on high field spin-echo high resolution magnetic resonance images and were able to delineate all five nigrosomes. In accordance with the pathological literature we did not observe changes in the nigrosome structure as manifest by volume or signal characteristics within the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease whereas in progressive supranuclear palsy there was microarchitectural destruction.},

	abstract = {Aims To better characterize progression of neurodegenerative diseases involving the hippocampus (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), significant research focus has been devoted to the accurate delineation of the hippocampus and its subfields. Due to the insights gained from "big data" efforts, such as ADNI, automation of these techniques is an absolute necessity. Method We detail a significant modification of the ASHS (Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields) framework [1] made available as open source through the well-known Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and its R-based extension, ANTsR. Innovations include a new joint label fusion implementation with the use of non-negative least squares for weighting of individual atlases and subsequent refinement employs a four-class random forest approach based on true/false x positive/negative classifications. A leave-one-out evaluation was performed on two data sets (one public and one private) consisting of separate subparcellation schemes (denoted as "Penn" and "UCI"). Results Warping of individual atlases to the target image resulted in an average Dice value over all labels: Penn: left = 0.587, right = 0.570 and UCI: left = 0.667, right = 0.680. NNLS JLF: Penn: left = 0.751, right = 0.744 and UCI: left = 0.776, right = 0.779. RF Refinement: Penn: left = 0.762, right = 0.754 and UCI: left = 0.793, right = 0.785. Conclusion We provide an open-source pipeline for segmentation of hippocampal subfields using consensus labeling and refinement, which outperforms existing software. Results were applied to T1/T2 data but the framework is sufficiently general to accommodate other imaging protocols (e.g. T1-only).},

For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject. Copyright (C) 2000.},

	abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts- based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

We approached the problem using a highly precise computational technique for shape comparison. Starting with a prospectively acquired sample of cranial MRIs of healthy volunteers (age ranges 18-84), the variations of individual callosa are quantified with respect to a reference callosum shape in the form of Jacobian determinant maps derived from the geometric transformations that map the reference callosum into anatomic alignment with the subject callosa. Voxelwise t tests performed over the determinant values demonstrated that females had a larger splenium than males (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons) while males possessed a larger genu (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). In addition, pointwise Pearson plots using age as a correlate showed a different pattern of age-related changes in male and female callosa, with female splenia tending to expand more with age, while the male genu tended to contract. Our results demonstrate significant morphologic differences in the corpus callosum between genders and a possible sex difference in the neuro-developmental cycle. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {A progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) is considered the main feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent neuropathological evidence however suggests that the axons of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system are the earliest target of alpha-synuclein accumulation in PD, thus the principal site for vulnerability. Whether this applies to in vivo PD, and also to the mesolimbic system has not been investigated yet. We used [11C]FeCIT PET to measure presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) activity in both nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems, in 36 early PD patients (mean disease duration in months 10.7) and 14 healthy controls similar for age. We also performed anatomically-driven partial correlation analysis to evaluate possible changes in the connectivity within both the dopamine networks at an early clinical phase. In the nigrostriatal system, we found a severe DAT reduction in the afferents to the dorsal putamen (DPU) (η2= 0.84), whereas the SN was the less affected region (η2=0.31). DAT activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the ventral striatum (VST) were also reduced in the patient group, but to a lesser degree (VST η2=0.71 and VTA η2=0.31). In the PD patients compared to the controls, there was a marked decrease in dopamine network connectivity between SN and DPU nodes, supporting the significant derangement in the nigrostriatal pathway. These results suggest that neurodegeneration in the dopamine pathways is initially more prominent in the afferent axons and more severe in the nigrostriatal system. Considering PD as a disconnection syndrome starting from the axons, it would justify neuroprotective interventions even if patients have already manifested clinical symptoms.},

	abstract = {We present a new framework for predicting cognitive or other continuous-variable data from medical images. Current methods of probing the connection between medical images and other clinical data typically use voxel-based mass univariate approaches. These approaches do not take into account the multivariate, network-based interactions between the various areas of the brain and do not give readily interpretable metrics that describe how strongly cognitive function is related to neuroanatomical structure. On the other hand, high-dimensional machine learning techniques do not typically provide a direct method for discovering which parts of the brain are used for making predictions. We present a framework, based on recent work in sparse linear regression, that addresses both drawbacks of mass univariate approaches, while preserving the direct spatial interpretability that they provide. In addition, we present a novel optimization algorithm that adapts the conjugate gradient method for sparse regression on medical imaging data. This algorithm produces coefficients that are more interpretable than existing sparse regression techniques. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Structured sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) models have been used to identify imaging genetic associations. These models either use group lasso or graph-guided fused lasso to conduct feature selection and feature grouping simultaneously. The group lasso based methods require prior knowledge to define the groups, which limits the capability when prior knowledge is incomplete or unavailable. The graph-guided methods overcome this drawback by using the sample correlation to define the constraint. However, they are sensitive to the sign of the sample correlation, which could introduce undesirable bias if the sign is wrongly estimated. We introduce a novel SCCA model with a new penalty, and develop an efficient optimization algorithm. Our method has a strong upper bound for the grouping effect for both positively and negatively correlated features. We show that our method performs better than or equally to three competing SCCA models on both synthetic and real data. In particular, our method identifies stronger canonical correlations and better canonical loading patterns, showing its promise for revealing interesting imaging genetic associations.

Each of these three sets consists of three T1- and T2-weighted MR images of the brain acquired with a 3T MRI scanner. The task was to segment cortical grey matter, non-myelinated and myelinated white matter, brainstem, basal ganglia and thalami, cerebellum, and cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and in the extracerebral space separately. Any team could upload the results and all segmentations were evaluated in the same way. This paper presents the results of eight participating teams.

	abstract = {Background: The neuroanatomical substrates of Parkinson's disease (PD) with tremor-dominance (TD) and those with non-tremor dominance (nTD), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), and akinetic-rigid (AR) are not fully differentiated. A better understanding of symptom specific pathoanatomical markers of PD subtypes may result in earlier diagnosis and more tailored treatment. Here, we aim to give an overview of the neuroimaging literature that compared PD motor subtypes. Methods: A systematic literature review on neuroimaging studies of PD subtypes was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Search terms submitted to the PubMed database included: “Parkinson's disease”, “MRI” and “motor subtypes” (TD, nTD, PIGD, AR). The results are first discussed from macro to micro level of organization (i.e., (1) structural; (2) functional; and (3) molecular) and then by applied imaging methodology. Findings: Several neuroimaging methods including diffusion imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) distinguish specific PD motor subtypes well, although findings are mixed. Furthermore, our review demonstrates that nTD-PD patients have more severe neuroalterations compared to TD-PD patients. More specifically, nTD-PD patients have deficits within striato-thalamo-cortical (STC) circuitry and other thalamocortical projections related to cognitive and sensorimotor function, while TD-PD patients tend to have greater cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuitry dysfunction. Conclusions: Based on the literature, STC and CTC circuitry deficits seem to be the key features of PD and the subtypes. Future research should make greater use of multimodal neuroimaging and techniques that have higher sensitivity in delineating subcortical structures involved in motor diseases.},

However, the evolutionarily relevant molecular variants impacting key aspects of neuroanatomy are largely unknown. Here, we integrate evolutionary annotations of the genome at diverse timescales with common variant associations from large-scale neuroimaging genetic screens. We find that alleles with evidence of recent positive polygenic selection over the past 2000-3000 years are associated with increased surface area (SA) of the entire cortex, as well as specific regions, including those involved in spoken language and visual processing. Therefore, polygenic selective pressures impact the structure of specific cortical areas even over relatively recent timescales. Moreover, common sequence variation within human gained enhancers active in the prenatal cortex is associated with postnatal global SA. We show that such variation modulates the function of a regulatory element of the developmentally relevant transcription factor HEY2 in human neural progenitor cells and is associated with structural changes in the inferior frontal cortex. These results indicate that non-coding genomic regions active during prenatal cortical development are involved in the evolution of human brain structure and identify novel regulatory elements and genes impacting modern human brain structure.},

As expected, magnetic resonance imaging is a major component of the project. Full brain images are obtained at every 6-month visit. A range of cognitive tests studying executive function and memory are employed less frequently. Two blood draws (baseline, 6 months) provide samples to measure concentrations of approximately 145 plasma biomarkers. In addition, other diagnostic measurements are performed including PET imaging, cerebral spinal fluid measurements of amyloid-beta and tau peptides, as well as genetic tests, demographics, and vital signs. ADNI data is available upon review of an application. There have been numerous reports of how various processes evolve during AD progression, including alterations in metabolic and neuroendocrine activity, cell survival, and cognitive behavior. Lacking an analytic model at the onset, we leveraged recent advances in machine learning, which allow us to deal with large, non-linear systems with many variables. Of particular note was examining how well binary predictions of future disease states could be learned from simple, non-invasive measurements like those dependent on blood samples. Such measurements make relatively little demands on the time and effort of medical staff or patient. We report findings with recall/precision/area under the receiver operator curve after application of CART, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, Our results show (i) Random Forests and Gradient Boosting work very well with such data, (ii) Prediction quality when applied to relatively easily obtained measurements (Cognitive scores, Genetic Risk and plasma biomarkers) achieve results that are competitive with magnetic resonance techniques. This is by no means an exhaustive study, but instead an exploration of the plausibility of defining a series of relatively inexpensive, broad population based tests.},

	doi = {10.1002/mds.26251},
	abstract = {Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is histopathologically characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The depletion of these neurons is thought to reduce the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway, as well as the neural fibers that link the substantia nigra to the striatum (putamen and caudate), causing a dysregulation in striatal activity that ultimately leads to lack of movement control. Based on diffusion tensor imaging, visualizing this pathway and measuring alterations of the fiber integrity remain challenging. The objectives were to 1) develop a diffusion tensor tractography protocol for reliably tracking the nigrostriatal fibers on multicenter data; 2) test whether the integrities measured by diffusion tensor imaging of the nigrostriatal fibers are abnormal in PD; and 3) test whether abnormal integrities of the nigrostriatal fibers in PD patients are associated with the severity of motor disability and putaminal dopamine binding ratios. Methods: Diffusion tensor tractography was performed on 50 drug-naïve PD patients and 27 healthy control subjects from the international multicenter Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative. Results: Tractography consistently detected the nigrostriatal fibers, yielding reliable diffusion measures. Fractional anisotropy, along with radial and axial diffusivity of the nigrostriatal tract, showed systematic abnormalities in patients. In addition, variations in fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity of the nigrostriatal tract were associated with the degree of motor deficits in PD patients. Conclusion: Taken together, the findings imply that the diffusion tensor imaging characteristic of the nigrostriatal tract is potentially an index for detecting and staging of early PD. © 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in structural diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in PD which has shed light on our understanding of structural abnormalities underlying PD symptoms or its associations with pathological mechanisms. One of the white matter tracts shown to be disrupted in PD with a possible contribution to some PD symptoms is the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). On the whole, lower ILF integrity contributes to thought disorders, impaired visual emotions, cognitive impairments such as semantic fluency deficits, and mood disorders. This review outlines the microstructural changes in ILF associated with systemic inflammation and various PD symptoms like cognitive decline, facial emotion recognition deficit, depression, color discrimination deficit, olfactory dysfunction, and tremor genesis. However, few studies have investigated DTI correlates of each symptom and larger studies with standardized imaging protocols are required to extend these preliminary findings and lead to more promising results.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to identify the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in measuring the regional distribution of abnormal microstructural progression in patients with Parkinson's disease who were enrolled in the Parkinson's progression marker initiative (PPMI). One hundred and twenty two de-novo PD patients (age = 60.5±9) and 50 healthy controls (age = 60.6±11) had DTI scans at baseline and 12.6±1 months later. Automated image processing included an intra-subject registration of all time points and an inter-subjects registration to a brain atlas. Annualized rates of DTI variations including fractional anisotropy (FA), radial (rD) and axial (aD) diffusivity were estimated in a total of 118 white matter and subcortical regions of interest. A mixed effects model framework was used to determine the degree to which DTI changes differed in PD relative to changes in healthy subjects. Significant DTI changes were also tested for correlations with changes in clinical measures, dopaminergic imaging and CSF biomarkers in PD patients. Compared to normal aging, PD was associated with higher rates of FA reduction, rD and aD increases predominantly in the substantia nigra, midbrain and thalamus. The highest rates of FA reduction involved the substantia nigra (3.6±1.4\%/year from baseline, whereas the highest rates of increased diffusivity involved the thalamus (rD: 8.0±2.9\%/year, aD: 4.0±1.5\%/year). In PD patients, high DTI changes in the substantia nigra correlated with increasing dopaminergic deficits as well as with declining alpha-synuclein and total tau protein concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. Increased DTI rates in the thalamus correlated with progressive decline in global cognition in PD. The results suggest that higher rates of regional microstructural degeneration are potential markers of PD progression.},

The purpose of the current study was to replicate recent methods that have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to compare individuals with PD with and without depression and to extend previous findings to allow for a better understanding of the results. Methods: Thirty-seven participants with de novo PD were retrieved from the Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) and were separated into a depressed PD group (dPD) or a non-depressed PD group (ndPD). Groups were determined based on scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-15). Initially, a replicated cut off score of ≥ 5 for dPD and {\textbackslash}textless5 for ndPD was applied. To better understand the results, we secondarily applied a more extreme group analysis with ≥ 9 for dPD and 0 for ndPD. White matter integrity between groups was compared between groups using tract-based spatial statistics. Results and Conclusion: The current study did not reveal significant differences in white matter microstructure between dPD and ndPD groups at the whole brain level or in specific regions of interest. The extreme group results were consistent. These findings did not replicate previous work that found reduced white matter integrity in limbic prefrontal regions in dPD relative to ndPD.

Movement deficits and subtypes in PD subjects were assessed using the Motor Subscale (Part III) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Reduced fractional anisotropy (P {\textbackslash}textless .05, corrected) was found in PD subjects in regions related to the precentral gyrus, substantia nigra, putamen, posterior striatum, frontal lobe, and the supplementary motor areas. Reduced fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra correlated (P {\textbackslash}textless .05, corrected) with the increased rating scale motor scores.

	abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows measuring fractional anisotropy and similar microstructural indices of the brain white matter. Lower than normal fractional anisotropy as well as higher than normal diffusivity is associated with loss of microstructural integrity and neurodegeneration. Previous DTI studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have demonstrated abnormal fractional anisotropy in multiple white matter regions, particularly in the dopaminergic nuclei and dopaminergic pathways. However, DTI is not considered a diagnostic marker for the earliest Parkinson's disease since anisotropic alterations present a temporally divergent pattern during the earliest Parkinson's course. This article reviews a majority of clinically employed DTI studies in PD, and it aims to prove the utilities of DTI as a marker of diagnosing PD, correlating clinical symptomatology, tracking disease progression, and treatment effects. To address the challenge of DTI being a diagnostic marker for early PD, this article also provides a comparison of the results from a longitudinal, early stage, multicenter clinical cohort of Parkinson's research with previous publications. This review provides evidences of DTI as a promising marker for monitoring PD progression and classifying atypical PD types, and it also interprets the possible pathophysiologic processes under the complex pattern of fractional anisotropic changes in the first few years of PD. Recent technical advantages, limitations, and further research strategies of clinical DTI in PD are additionally discussed.},

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {Super resolution (SR) methods typically assume that the low-resolution (LR) image was downscaled from the unknown high-resolution (HR) image by a fixed 'ideal' downscaling kernel (e.g. Bicubic downscaling). However, this is rarely the case in real LR images, in contrast to synthetically generated SR datasets. When the assumed downscaling kernel deviates from the true one, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates. This gave rise to Blind-SR - namely, SR when the downscaling kernel (“SR-kernel”) is unknown. It was further shown that the true SR-kernel is the one that maximizes the recurrence of patches across scales of the LR image. In this paper we show how this powerful cross-scale recurrence property can be realized using Deep Internal Learning. We introduce “KernelGAN”, an image-specific Internal-GAN [29], which trains solely on the LR test image at test time, and learns its internal distribution of patches. Its Generator is trained to produce a downscaled version of the LR test image, such that its Discriminator cannot distinguish between the patch distribution of the downscaled image, and the patch distribution of the original LR image. The Generator, once trained, constitutes the downscaling operation with the correct image-specific SR-kernel. KernelGAN is fully unsupervised, requires no training data other than the input image itself, and leads to state-of-the-art results in Blind-SR when plugged into existing SR algorithms.},

	abstract = {Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy – Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) are often represented by similar clinical symptoms, which may challenge diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare regional cerebral diffusion properties in PD and PSP-RS subjects and evaluate the use of these metrics for an automatic classification framework.
Material and methods
Diffusion-tensor MRI datasets from 52 PD and 21 PSP-RS subjects were employed for this study. Using an atlas-based approach, regional median values of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were measured and employed for feature selection using RELIEFF and subsequent classification using a support vector machine.
Results
According to RELIEFF, the top 17 diffusion values consisting of deep gray matter structures, the brainstem, and frontal cortex were found to be especially informative for an automatic classification. A MANCOVA analysis performed on these diffusion values as dependent variables revealed that PSP-RS and PD subjects differ significantly (p {\textless} .001). Generally, PSP-RS subjects exhibit reduced FA, and increased MD, RD, and AD values in nearly all brain structures analyzed compared to PD subjects. The leave-one-out cross-validation of the support vector machine classifier revealed that the classifier can differentiate PD and PSP-RS subjects with an accuracy of 87.7\%. More precisely, six PD subjects were wrongly classified as PSP-RS and three PSP-RS subjects were wrongly classified as PD.
Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that PSP-RS subjects exhibit widespread and more severe diffusion alterations compared to PD patients, which appears valuable for an automatic computer-aided diagnosis approach.},

	abstract = {Non-manifesting carriers (NMCs) of Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related mutations such as LRRK2 and GBA are at an increased risk for developing PD. Dopamine transporter (DaT)-spectral positron emission computed tomography is widely used for capturing functional nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. However, it does not reflect other ongoing neuronal processes; especially in the prodromal stages of the disease. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been proposed as a mode for assessing functional alterations associated with PD, but its relation to dopaminergic deficiency remains unclear. We aimed to study the association between presynaptic striatal dopamine uptake and functional connectivity (FC) patterns among healthy first-degree relatives of PD patients with mutations in LRRK2 and GBA genes. N = 85 healthy first-degree subjects were enrolled and genotyped. All participants underwent DaT and rs-fMRI scans, as well as a comprehensive clinical assessment battery. Between-group differences in FC within striatal regions were investigated and compared with striatal binding ratios (SBR). N = 26 GBA-NMCs, N = 25 LRRK2-NMCs, and N = 34 age-matched nonmanifesting noncarriers (NM-NCs) were included in each study group based on genetic status. While genetically-defined groups were similar across clinical measures, LRRK2-NMCs demonstrated lower SBR in the right putamen compared with NM-NCs, and higher right putamen FC compared to GBA-NMCs. In this group, higher striatal FC was associated with increased risk for PD. The observed differential SBR and FC patterns among LRRK2-NMCs and GBA-NMCs indicate that DaTscan and FC assessments might offer a more sensitive prediction of the risk for PD in the pre-clinical stages of the disease.},

	abstract = {Although the discovery of the critical role of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is now twenty-five years old, it still represents a milestone in PD research. Abnormal forms of alpha-syn trigger selective and progressive neuronal death through mitochondrial impairment, lysosomal dysfunction, and alteration of calcium homeostasis not only in PD but also in other alpha-syn-related neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Furthermore, alpha-syn-dependent early synaptic and plastic alterations and the underlying mechanisms preceding overt neurodegeneration have attracted great interest. In particular, the presence of early inflammation in experimental models and PD patients, occurring before deposition and spreading of alpha-syn, suggests a mechanistic link between inflammation and synaptic dysfunction. The knowledge of these early mechanisms is of seminal importance to support the research on reliable biomarkers to precociously identify the disease and possible disease-modifying therapies targeting alpha-syn. In this review, we will discuss these critical issues, providing a state of the art of the role of this protein in early PD and other synucleinopathies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAAs) have the potential to differentiate people with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls. We used the well characterised, multicentre Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort to further assess the diagnostic performance of the alpha-synuclein SAA and to examine whether the assay identifies heterogeneity among patients and enables the early identification of at-risk groups.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis is based on assessments done at enrolment for PPMI participants (including people with sporadic Parkinson's disease from LRRK2 and GBA variants, healthy controls, prodromal individuals with either rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) or hyposmia, and non-manifesting carriers of LRRK2 and GBA variants) from 33 participating academic neurology outpatient practices worldwide (in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK, and the USA). alpha-synuclein SAA analysis of CSF was performed using previously described methods. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in participants with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, including subgroups based on genetic and clinical features. We established the frequency of positive alpha-synuclein SAA results in prodromal participants (RBD and hyposmia) and non-manifesting carriers of genetic variants associated with Parkinson's disease, and compared alpha-synuclein SAA to clinical measures and other biomarkers. We used odds ratio estimates with 95\% CIs to measure the association between alpha-synuclein SAA status and categorical measures, and two-sample 95\% CIs from the resampling method to assess differences in medians between alpha-synuclein SAA positive and negative participants for continuous measures. A linear regression model was used to control for potential confounders such as age and sex.
FINDINGS: This analysis included 1123 participants who were enrolled between July 7, 2010, and July 4, 2019. Of these, 545 had Parkinson's disease, 163 were healthy controls, 54 were participants with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit, 51 were prodromal participants, and 310 were non-manifesting carriers. Sensitivity for Parkinson's disease was 87·7\% (95\% CI 84·9-90·5), and specificity for healthy controls was 96·3\% (93·4-99·2). The sensitivity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in sporadic Parkinson's disease with the typical olfactory deficit was 98·6\% (96·4-99·4). The proportion of positive alpha-synuclein SAA was lower than this figure in subgroups including LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (67·5\% [59·2-75·8]) and participants with sporadic Parkinson's disease without olfactory deficit (78·3\% [69·8-86·7]). Participants with LRRK2 variant and normal olfaction had an even lower alpha-synuclein SAA positivity rate (34·7\% [21·4-48·0]). Among prodromal and at-risk groups, 44 (86\%) of 51 of participants with RBD or hyposmia had positive alpha-synuclein SAA (16 of 18 with hyposmia, and 28 of 33 with RBD). 25 (8\%) of 310 non-manifesting carriers (14 of 159 [9\%] LRRK2 and 11 of 151 [7\%] GBA) were positive.
INTERPRETATION: This study represents the largest analysis so far of the alpha-synuclein SAA for the biochemical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Our results show that the assay classifies people with Parkinson's disease with high sensitivity and specificity, provides information about molecular heterogeneity, and detects prodromal individuals before diagnosis. These findings suggest a crucial role for the alpha-synuclein SAA in therapeutic development, both to identify pathologically defined subgroups of people with Parkinson's disease and to establish biomarker-defined at-risk cohorts.

Although previous studies have proposed multimodal MRI protocols combined with multivariate analysis to discriminate between these two populations and healthy controls, studies combining all MRI indexes relevant for these disorders (i.e. grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, iron deposition, brain activity at rest and brain connectivity) with a completely data-driven voxelwise analysis for discrimination are still lacking. In this study, we used such a complete MRI protocol and adapted a fully-data driven analysis pipeline to discriminate between these populations and a healthy controls (HC) group. The pipeline combined several feature selection and reduction steps to obtain interpretable models with a low number of discriminant features that can shed light onto the brain pathology of PD and MSA. Using this pipeline, we could discriminate between PD and HC (best accuracy = 0.78), MSA and HC (best accuracy = 0.94) and PD and MSA (best accuracy = 0.88). Moreover, we showed that indexes derived from resting-state fMRI alone could discriminate between PD and HC, while mean diffusivity in the cerebellum and the putamen alone could discriminate between MSA and HC. On the other hand, a more diverse set of indexes derived by multiple modalities was needed to discriminate between the two disorders. We showed that our pipeline was able to discriminate between distinct pathological populations while delivering sparse model that could be used to better understand the neural underpinning of the pathologies.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease varies in severity and age of onset. One source of this variability is sex. Males are twice as likely as females to develop Parkinson’s disease, and tend to have more severe symptoms and greater speed of progression. However, to date, there is little information in large cohorts on sex differences in the patterns of neurodegeneration. Here we used MRI and clinical information from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative to measure structural brain differences between sexes in Parkinson’s disease after regressing out the expected effect of age and sex. We derived atrophy maps from deformation-based morphometry of T1-weighted MRI and connectivity from diffusion-weighted MRI in de novo Parkinson’s disease patients (149 males: 83 females) with comparable clinical severity, and healthy control participants (78 males: 39 females). Overall, even though the two patient groups were matched for disease duration and severity, males demonstrated generally greater brain atrophy and disrupted connectivity. Males with Parkinson’s disease had significantly greater tissue loss than females in 11 cortical regions including bilateral frontal and left insular lobe, right postcentral gyrus, left inferior temporal and cingulate gyrus and left thalamus, while females had greater atrophy in six cortical regions, including regions in the left frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, left insular gyrus and right occipital cortex. Local efficiency of white matter connectivity showed greater disruption in males in multiple regions such as basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. These findings support the idea that development of Parkinson’s disease may involve different pathological mechanisms and yield distinct prognosis in males and females, which may have implications for research into neuroprotection, and stratification for clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Individuals with Parkinson’s disease present with a complex clinical phenotype, encompassing sleep, motor, cognitive, and affective disturbances. However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the “average” patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method—similarity network fusion—to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson’s disease from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from the fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.},

The Pediatric Template of Brain Perfusion (PTBP) is a free and public neuroimaging resource that will help accelerate the understanding of childhood brain development as seen through the lens of multiple modality neuroimaging and in relation to cognitive and environmental factors. The PTBP uses cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI to quantify cortex, white matter, resting state functional connectivity and brain perfusion, as measured by Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), in 120 children 7–18 years of age. We describe the PTBP and show, as a demonstration of validity, that global summary measurements capture the trajectories that demarcate critical turning points in brain maturation.

	abstract = {Combat military and civilian law enforcement personnel may be exposed to repetitive low-intensity blast events during training and operations. Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as “breachers” or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

Founded in 2008 with the highly regarded Symmetric Normalization image registration framework, the ANTs library has since grown to include additional functionality. Recent enhancements include statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network architectures and trained models for specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These pipelines significantly improve computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs workflows and simultaneously illustrate the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework for medical image analysis.},

The aim of this study was to assess signal changes in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease using an optimized neuromelanin-sensitive T1 scan. Ten patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 matched controls underwent high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with magnetization transfer effect at 3T. The size and signal intensity of the substantia nigra pars compacta were determined as the number of pixels with signal intensity higher than background signal intensity + 3 standard deviations and regional contrast ratio. Patients were subclassified as early stage (n = 6) and late stage (n = 4) using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr Parkinson's disease staging scale. The T1 hyperintense area in the substantia nigra was substantially smaller in patients compared with controls (−60\%, P {\textless} .01), and contrast was reduced (−3\%, P {\textless} .05). Size reduction was even more pronounced in more advanced disease (−78\%) than in early-stage disease (−47\%). We present preliminary findings using a modified T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging technique showing stage-dependent substantia nigra signal reduction in Parkinson's disease as a putative marker of neuromelanin loss. Our data suggest that reduction in the size of neuromelanin-rich substantia nigra correlates well with postmortem observations of dopaminergic neuron loss. Further validation of our results could potentially lead to development of a new biomarker of disease progression in Parkinson's disease. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

	abstract = {This study focused on the substantia nigra (SN) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We measured its area and volume, mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and iron concentration in early and late PD and correlated the values with clinical scores. Twenty-two early PD (EPD), 20 late PD (LPD) and 20 healthy subjects (age 64.7 ± 4.9, 60.5 ± 6.1, and 61 ± 7.2 years, respectively) underwent 1.5 T MR imaging with double-TI-IR T1-weighted, T2*-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. Relative SN area, MD, FA and R2* were measured in ROIs traced on SN. Correlation with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores was assessed. In LPD, the SN area was significantly reduced with respect to EPD (p = 0.04) and control subjects (p {\textless} 0.001). In EPD, the SN area was also significantly smaller than in controls (p = 0.006). Similarly, the SN volume significantly differed between LPD and controls (p = 0.001) and between EPD and LPD (p = 0.049), while no significant differences were found between controls and EPD. Both SN area (r = 0.47, p = 0.004) and volume (r = 0.46, p = 0.005) correlated with UPDRS scores. At 1.5 T, SN morphological measurements were sensitive to early PD changes and able to track the disease progression, while MD and FA measures and relaxometry did not provide significant results.},

	abstract = {One objective of modern neuroimaging is to identify markers that can aid in diagnosis, disease progression monitoring and long-term drug impact analysis. In this study, Parkinson-associated physiopathological modifications were characterized in six subcortical structures by simultaneously measuring quantitative magnetic resonance parameters sensitive to complementary tissue characteristics (i.e. volume atrophy, iron deposition and microstructural damage). Thirty patients with Parkinson’s disease and 22 control subjects underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging with T2*-weighted, whole-brain T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. The mean R2* value, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy in the pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, substantia nigra and red nucleus were compared between patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects. Comparisons were also performed using voxel-based analysis of R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps to determine which subregion of the basal ganglia showed the greater difference for each parameter. Averages of each subregion were then used in a logistic regression analysis. Compared with control subjects, patients with Parkinson’s disease displayed significantly higher R2* values in the substantia nigra, lower fractional anisotropy values in the substantia nigra and thalamus, and higher mean diffusivity values in the thalamus. Voxel-based analyses confirmed these results and, in addition, showed a significant difference in the mean diffusivity in the striatum. The combination of three markers was sufficient to obtain a 95\% global accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for discriminating patients with Parkinson’s disease from controls. The markers comprising discriminating combinations were R2* in the substantia nigra, fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra and mean diffusivity in the putamen or caudate nucleus. Remarkably, the predictive markers involved the nigrostriatal structures that characterize Parkinson’s physiopathology. Furthermore, highly discriminating combinations included markers from three different magnetic resonance parameters (R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy). These findings demonstrate that multimodal magnetic resonance imaging of subcortical grey matter structures is useful for the evaluation of Parkinson’s disease and, possibly, of other subcortical pathologies.},

	abstract = {One of the most common monogenic forms of Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by mutations in the LRRK2 gene that encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2 mutations, and particularly the most common mutation Gly2019Ser, are observed in patients with autosomal dominant PD and in those with apparent sporadic PD, who are clinically indistinguishable from those with idiopathic PD. The discoveries that pathogenic mutations in the LRRK2 gene increase LRRK2 kinase activity and that small-molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors can be neuroprotective in preclinical models of PD have placed LRRK2 at the centre of disease modification efforts in PD. Recent investigations also suggest that LRRK2 has a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD and that LRRK2 therapies might, therefore, be beneficial in this common subtype of PD. In this Review, we describe the characteristics of LRRK2-associated PD that are most relevant to the development of LRRK2-targeted therapies and the design and implementation of clinical trials. We highlight strategies for correcting the effects of mutations in the LRRK2 gene, focusing on how to identify which patients are the optimal candidates and how to decide on the timing of such trials. In addition, we discuss challenges in implementing trials of disease-modifying treatment in people who carry LRRK2 mutations.},

	abstract = {Classical accounts of the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease have emphasized degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with consequent dysfunction of cortico–striatal–thalamic loops. In contrast, post-mortem studies indicate that pathological changes in Parkinson’s disease (Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. The nigrostriatal and histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they do emphasize different anatomical structures. To address the question of which brain structures are functionally most affected by Parkinson’s disease, we performed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study focused on striatal functional connectivity. We contrasted 13 patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease versus 19 age-matched control subjects, using methodology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of head motion during scanning. The principal finding in the Parkinson’s disease group was markedly lower striatal correlations with thalamus, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. This result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease. Focally altered functional connectivity also was observed in sensori-motor and visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. Striatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was graded (posterior putamen \&gt; anterior putamen \&gt; caudate), in both patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects, in a manner that corresponds to well-documented gradient of striatal dopaminergic function loss in Parkinson’s disease. We hypothesize that this gradient provides a clue to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.},

	abstract = {See Nieuwhof and Helmich (doi:10.1093/brain/awx267) for a scientific commentary on this article.Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Previous studies measuring spontaneous brain activity using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging have reported abnormal changes in broadly distributed whole-brain networks. Although resting state functional connectivity, estimating temporal correlations between brain regions, is measured with the assumption that intrinsic fluctuations throughout the scan are stable, dynamic changes of functional connectivity have recently been suggested to reflect aspects of functional capacity of neural systems, and thus may serve as biomarkers of disease. The present work is the first study to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity in patients with Parkinson’s disease, with a focus on the temporal properties of functional connectivity states as well as the variability of network topological organization using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-one Parkinson’s disease patients and 23 healthy controls were studied using group spatial independent component analysis, a sliding windows approach, and graph-theory methods. The dynamic functional connectivity analyses suggested two discrete connectivity configurations: a more frequent, sparsely connected within-network state (State I) and a less frequent, more strongly interconnected between-network state (State II). In patients with Parkinson’s disease, the occurrence of the sparsely connected State I dropped by 12.62\%, while the expression of the more strongly interconnected State II increased by the same amount. This was consistent with the altered temporal properties of the dynamic functional connectivity characterized by a shortening of the dwell time of State I and by a proportional increase of the dwell time pattern in State II. These changes are suggestive of a reduction in functional segregation among networks and are correlated with the clinical severity of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Additionally, there was a higher variability in the network global efficiency, suggesting an abnormal global integration of the brain networks. The altered functional segregation and abnormal global integration in brain networks confirmed the vulnerability of functional connectivity networks in Parkinson’s disease.},

Strengths of the UPDRS include its wide utilization, its application across the clinical spectrum of PD, its nearly comprehensive coverage of motor symptoms, and its clinimetric properties, including reliability and validity. Weaknesses include several ambiguities in the written text, inadequate instructions for raters, some metric flaws, and the absence of screening questions on several important non-motor aspects of PD. The Task Force recommends that the MDS sponsor the development of a new version of the UPDRS and encourage efforts to establish its clinimetric properties, especially addressing the need to define a Minimal Clinically Relevant Difference and a Minimal Clinically Relevant Incremental Difference, as well as testing its correlation with the current UPDRS. If developed, the new scale should be culturally unbiased and be tested in different racial, gender, and age-groups. Future goals should include the definition of UPDRS scores with confidence intervals that correlate with clinically pertinent designations, “minimal,” “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” PD. Whereas the presence of non-motor components of PD can be identified with screening questions, a new version of the UPDRS should include an official appendix that includes other, more detailed, and optionally used scales to determine severity of these impairments. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society},

Despite several systematic reviews having summarised the evidence on diagnostic accuracy, the impact of imaging results on clinical utility has not been systematically assessed. Our objective was to examine the available evidence on the clinical utility of DaTscan imaging in changing diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with suspected PS. We performed a systematic review of published studies of clinical utility from 2000 to 2019 without language restrictions. A meta-analysis of change in diagnosis and management rates reported from each study was performed using a random-effects model and logit transformation. Sub-group analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was performed to explore heterogeneity. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen of these contributed to the meta-analyses including 950 and 779 patients with a reported change in management and change in diagnosis, respectively. The use of DaTscan imaging resulted in a change in management in 54\% (95\% CI: 47–61\%) of patients. Change in diagnosis occurred in 31\% (95\% CI: 22–42\%) of patients. The two pooled analyses were characterised by high levels of heterogeneity. Our systematic review and meta-analysis show that imaging with DaTscan was associated with a change in management in approximately half the patients tested and the diagnosis was modified in one third. Regardless of time from symptom onset to scan results, these changes were consistent. Further research focusing on specific patient subgroups could provide additional evidence on the impact on clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Images of DaTscan (ioflupane [123I] SPECT) have been used as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis to facilitate the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative (ND) Parkinsonian Syndrome (PS) vs. non-dopamine deficiency aetiologies of Parkinsonism. Despite several systematic reviews having summarised the evidence on diagnostic accuracy, the impact of imaging results on clinical utility has not been systematically assessed. Our objective was to examine the available evidence on the clinical utility of DaTscan imaging in changing diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with suspected PS. We performed a systematic review of published studies of clinical utility from 2000 to 2019 without language restrictions. A meta-analysis of change in diagnosis and management rates reported from each study was performed using a random-effects model and logit transformation. Sub-group analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was performed to explore heterogeneity. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen of these contributed to the meta-analyses including 950 and 779 patients with a reported change in management and change in diagnosis, respectively. The use of DaTscan imaging resulted in a change in management in 54\% (95\% CI: 47–61\%) of patients. Change in diagnosis occurred in 31\% (95\% CI: 22–42\%) of patients. The two pooled analyses were characterised by high levels of heterogeneity. Our systematic review and meta-analysis show that imaging with DaTscan was associated with a change in management in approximately half the patients tested and the diagnosis was modified in one third. Regardless of time from symptom onset to scan results, these changes were consistent. Further research focusing on specific patient subgroups could provide additional evidence on the impact on clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy – Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) are often represented by similar clinical symptoms, which may challenge diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare regional cerebral diffusion properties in PD and PSP-RS subjects and evaluate the use of these metrics for an automatic classification framework.
Material and methods
Diffusion-tensor MRI datasets from 52 PD and 21 PSP-RS subjects were employed for this study. Using an atlas-based approach, regional median values of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were measured and employed for feature selection using RELIEFF and subsequent classification using a support vector machine.
Results
According to RELIEFF, the top 17 diffusion values consisting of deep gray matter structures, the brainstem, and frontal cortex were found to be especially informative for an automatic classification. A MANCOVA analysis performed on these diffusion values as dependent variables revealed that PSP-RS and PD subjects differ significantly (p {\textless} .001). Generally, PSP-RS subjects exhibit reduced FA, and increased MD, RD, and AD values in nearly all brain structures analyzed compared to PD subjects. The leave-one-out cross-validation of the support vector machine classifier revealed that the classifier can differentiate PD and PSP-RS subjects with an accuracy of 87.7\%. More precisely, six PD subjects were wrongly classified as PSP-RS and three PSP-RS subjects were wrongly classified as PD.
Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that PSP-RS subjects exhibit widespread and more severe diffusion alterations compared to PD patients, which appears valuable for an automatic computer-aided diagnosis approach.},

    abstract = {The micro-architecture of the substantia nigra was studied in control cases of varying age and patients with parkinsonism. A single 7μ section stained with haematoxylin and eosin was examined at a specific level within the caudal nigra using strict criteria. The pars compacta was divided into a ventral and a dorsal tier, and each tier was further subdivided into 3 regions. In 36 control cases there was a linear fallout of pigmented neurons with advancing age in the pars compacta of the caudal substantia nigra at a rate of 4.7\% per decade. Regionally, the lateral ventral tier was relatively spared (2.1\% loss per decade) compared with the medial ventral tier (5.4\%) and the dorsal tier (6.9\%). In 20 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases of varying disease duration there was an exponential loss of pigmented neurons with a 45\% loss in the first decade. Regionally, the pattern was opposite to ageing. Loss was greatest in the lateral ventral tier (average loss 91\%) followed by the medial ventral tier (71\%) and the dorsal tier (56\%). The presymptomatic phase of PD from the onset of neuronal loss was estimated to be about 5 yrs. This phase is represented by incidental Lewy body cases: individuals who die without clinical signs of PD or dementia, but who are found to have Lewy bodies at post-mortem. In 7 cases cell loss was confined to the lateral ventral tier (average loss 52\%) congruent with the lateral ventral selectivity of symptomatic PD. It was calculated that at the onset of symptoms there was a 68\% cell loss in the lateral ventral tier and a 48\% loss in the caudal nigra as a whole. The regional selectivity of PD is relatively specific. In 15 cases of striatonigral degeneration the distribution of cell loss was similar, but the loss in the dorsal tier was greater than PD by 21\%. In 14 cases of Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (SRO) there was no predilection for the lateral ventral tier, but a tendency to involve the medial nigra and spare the lateral. These findings suggest that age-related of pigmented nigral cells is not an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD.},

	abstract = {Although the discovery of the critical role of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is now twenty-five years old, it still represents a milestone in PD research. Abnormal forms of alpha-syn trigger selective and progressive neuronal death through mitochondrial impairment, lysosomal dysfunction, and alteration of calcium homeostasis not only in PD but also in other alpha-syn-related neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Furthermore, alpha-syn-dependent early synaptic and plastic alterations and the underlying mechanisms preceding overt neurodegeneration have attracted great interest. In particular, the presence of early inflammation in experimental models and PD patients, occurring before deposition and spreading of alpha-syn, suggests a mechanistic link between inflammation and synaptic dysfunction. The knowledge of these early mechanisms is of seminal importance to support the research on reliable biomarkers to precociously identify the disease and possible disease-modifying therapies targeting alpha-syn. In this review, we will discuss these critical issues, providing a state of the art of the role of this protein in early PD and other synucleinopathies.},

	abstract = {Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy1. Clinically, it is challenging to differentiate Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, especially at the early stages of disease2. Aggregates of alpha-synuclein in distinct synucleinopathies have been proposed to represent different conformational strains of alpha-synuclein that can self-propagate and spread from cell to cell3-6. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is a technique that has previously been used to detect alpha-synuclein aggregates in samples of cerebrospinal fluid with high sensitivity and specificity7,8. Here we show that the alpha-synuclein-PMCA assay can discriminate between samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and samples from patients with multiple system atrophy, with an overall sensitivity of 95.4\%. We used a combination of biochemical, biophysical and biological methods to analyse the product of alpha-synuclein-PMCA, and found that the characteristics of the alpha-synuclein aggregates in the cerebrospinal fluid could be used to readily distinguish between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. We also found that the properties of aggregates that were amplified from the cerebrospinal fluid were similar to those of aggregates that were amplified from the brain. These findings suggest that alpha-synuclein aggregates that are associated with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy correspond to different conformational strains of alpha-synuclein, which can be amplified and detected by alpha-synuclein-PMCA. Our results may help to improve our understanding of the mechanism of alpha-synuclein misfolding and the structures of the aggregates that are implicated in different synucleinopathies, and may also enable the development of a biochemical assay to discriminate between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAAs) have the potential to differentiate people with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls. We used the well characterised, multicentre Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort to further assess the diagnostic performance of the alpha-synuclein SAA and to examine whether the assay identifies heterogeneity among patients and enables the early identification of at-risk groups.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis is based on assessments done at enrolment for PPMI participants (including people with sporadic Parkinson's disease from LRRK2 and GBA variants, healthy controls, prodromal individuals with either rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) or hyposmia, and non-manifesting carriers of LRRK2 and GBA variants) from 33 participating academic neurology outpatient practices worldwide (in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK, and the USA). alpha-synuclein SAA analysis of CSF was performed using previously described methods. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in participants with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, including subgroups based on genetic and clinical features. We established the frequency of positive alpha-synuclein SAA results in prodromal participants (RBD and hyposmia) and non-manifesting carriers of genetic variants associated with Parkinson's disease, and compared alpha-synuclein SAA to clinical measures and other biomarkers. We used odds ratio estimates with 95\% CIs to measure the association between alpha-synuclein SAA status and categorical measures, and two-sample 95\% CIs from the resampling method to assess differences in medians between alpha-synuclein SAA positive and negative participants for continuous measures. A linear regression model was used to control for potential confounders such as age and sex.
FINDINGS: This analysis included 1123 participants who were enrolled between July 7, 2010, and July 4, 2019. Of these, 545 had Parkinson's disease, 163 were healthy controls, 54 were participants with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit, 51 were prodromal participants, and 310 were non-manifesting carriers. Sensitivity for Parkinson's disease was 87·7\% (95\% CI 84·9-90·5), and specificity for healthy controls was 96·3\% (93·4-99·2). The sensitivity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in sporadic Parkinson's disease with the typical olfactory deficit was 98·6\% (96·4-99·4). The proportion of positive alpha-synuclein SAA was lower than this figure in subgroups including LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (67·5\% [59·2-75·8]) and participants with sporadic Parkinson's disease without olfactory deficit (78·3\% [69·8-86·7]). Participants with LRRK2 variant and normal olfaction had an even lower alpha-synuclein SAA positivity rate (34·7\% [21·4-48·0]). Among prodromal and at-risk groups, 44 (86\%) of 51 of participants with RBD or hyposmia had positive alpha-synuclein SAA (16 of 18 with hyposmia, and 28 of 33 with RBD). 25 (8\%) of 310 non-manifesting carriers (14 of 159 [9\%] LRRK2 and 11 of 151 [7\%] GBA) were positive.
INTERPRETATION: This study represents the largest analysis so far of the alpha-synuclein SAA for the biochemical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Our results show that the assay classifies people with Parkinson's disease with high sensitivity and specificity, provides information about molecular heterogeneity, and detects prodromal individuals before diagnosis. These findings suggest a crucial role for the alpha-synuclein SAA in therapeutic development, both to identify pathologically defined subgroups of people with Parkinson's disease and to establish biomarker-defined at-risk cohorts.

Although previous studies have proposed multimodal MRI protocols combined with multivariate analysis to discriminate between these two populations and healthy controls, studies combining all MRI indexes relevant for these disorders (i.e. grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, iron deposition, brain activity at rest and brain connectivity) with a completely data-driven voxelwise analysis for discrimination are still lacking. In this study, we used such a complete MRI protocol and adapted a fully-data driven analysis pipeline to discriminate between these populations and a healthy controls (HC) group. The pipeline combined several feature selection and reduction steps to obtain interpretable models with a low number of discriminant features that can shed light onto the brain pathology of PD and MSA. Using this pipeline, we could discriminate between PD and HC (best accuracy = 0.78), MSA and HC (best accuracy = 0.94) and PD and MSA (best accuracy = 0.88). Moreover, we showed that indexes derived from resting-state fMRI alone could discriminate between PD and HC, while mean diffusivity in the cerebellum and the putamen alone could discriminate between MSA and HC. On the other hand, a more diverse set of indexes derived by multiple modalities was needed to discriminate between the two disorders. We showed that our pipeline was able to discriminate between distinct pathological populations while delivering sparse model that could be used to better understand the neural underpinning of the pathologies.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease varies in severity and age of onset. One source of this variability is sex. Males are twice as likely as females to develop Parkinson’s disease, and tend to have more severe symptoms and greater speed of progression. However, to date, there is little information in large cohorts on sex differences in the patterns of neurodegeneration. Here we used MRI and clinical information from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative to measure structural brain differences between sexes in Parkinson’s disease after regressing out the expected effect of age and sex. We derived atrophy maps from deformation-based morphometry of T1-weighted MRI and connectivity from diffusion-weighted MRI in de novo Parkinson’s disease patients (149 males: 83 females) with comparable clinical severity, and healthy control participants (78 males: 39 females). Overall, even though the two patient groups were matched for disease duration and severity, males demonstrated generally greater brain atrophy and disrupted connectivity. Males with Parkinson’s disease had significantly greater tissue loss than females in 11 cortical regions including bilateral frontal and left insular lobe, right postcentral gyrus, left inferior temporal and cingulate gyrus and left thalamus, while females had greater atrophy in six cortical regions, including regions in the left frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, left insular gyrus and right occipital cortex. Local efficiency of white matter connectivity showed greater disruption in males in multiple regions such as basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. These findings support the idea that development of Parkinson’s disease may involve different pathological mechanisms and yield distinct prognosis in males and females, which may have implications for research into neuroprotection, and stratification for clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Individuals with Parkinson’s disease present with a complex clinical phenotype, encompassing sleep, motor, cognitive, and affective disturbances. However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the “average” patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method—similarity network fusion—to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson’s disease from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from the fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.},

The PTBP uses cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI to quantify cortex, white matter, resting state functional connectivity and brain perfusion, as measured by Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), in 120 children 7–18 years of age. We describe the PTBP and show, as a demonstration of validity, that global summary measurements capture the trajectories that demarcate critical turning points in brain maturation.

Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as “breachers” or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network architectures and trained models for specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These pipelines significantly improve computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs workflows and simultaneously illustrate the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework for medical image analysis.},

In this study, three traveling subjects were scanned at eight imaging centers equipped with the same type of scanners using the same multi-shell diffusion imaging protocol. Track density imaging and structure connectomes were investigated in local-scale distribution and in distal-scale connectivity, respectively. With evaluations of the coefficient of variation and the intra-class correlation coefficient, our results indicated: 1) similar to single-shell schemes, the intra-center reproducibility of multi-shell is higher than inter-center; 2) multi-shell schemes produce higher reproducibility and precision among centers compared to the single-shell schemes; and 3) in addition to the diffusion schemes, image quality and the presence of complex fiber structure could also associated with multicenter reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Depigmentation of the substantia nigra is a conspicuous pathological feature of Parkinson's disease and related to a loss of neuromelanin. Similar to melanin, neuromelanin has paramagnetic properties resulting in signal increase on specific T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was to assess signal changes in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease using an optimized neuromelanin-sensitive T1 scan. Ten patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 matched controls underwent high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with magnetization transfer effect at 3T. The size and signal intensity of the substantia nigra pars compacta were determined as the number of pixels with signal intensity higher than background signal intensity + 3 standard deviations and regional contrast ratio. Patients were subclassified as early stage (n = 6) and late stage (n = 4) using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr Parkinson's disease staging scale. The T1 hyperintense area in the substantia nigra was substantially smaller in patients compared with controls (−60\%, P {\textless} .01), and contrast was reduced (−3\%, P {\textless} .05). Size reduction was even more pronounced in more advanced disease (−78\%) than in early-stage disease (−47\%). We present preliminary findings using a modified T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging technique showing stage-dependent substantia nigra signal reduction in Parkinson's disease as a putative marker of neuromelanin loss. Our data suggest that reduction in the size of neuromelanin-rich substantia nigra correlates well with postmortem observations of dopaminergic neuron loss. Further validation of our results could potentially lead to development of a new biomarker of disease progression in Parkinson's disease. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

Relative SN area, MD, FA and R2* were measured in ROIs traced on SN. Correlation with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores was assessed. In LPD, the SN area was significantly reduced with respect to EPD (p = 0.04) and control subjects (p {\textless} 0.001). In EPD, the SN area was also significantly smaller than in controls (p = 0.006). Similarly, the SN volume significantly differed between LPD and controls (p = 0.001) and between EPD and LPD (p = 0.049), while no significant differences were found between controls and EPD. Both SN area (r = 0.47, p = 0.004) and volume (r = 0.46, p = 0.005) correlated with UPDRS scores.

Thirty patients with Parkinson’s disease and 22 control subjects underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging with T2*-weighted, whole-brain T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. The mean R2* value, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy in the pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, substantia nigra and red nucleus were compared between patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects. Comparisons were also performed using voxel-based analysis of R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps to determine which subregion of the basal ganglia showed the greater difference for each parameter. Averages of each subregion were then used in a logistic regression analysis. Compared with control subjects, patients with Parkinson’s disease displayed significantly higher R2* values in the substantia nigra, lower fractional anisotropy values in the substantia nigra and thalamus, and higher mean diffusivity values in the thalamus. Voxel-based analyses confirmed these results and, in addition, showed a significant difference in the mean diffusivity in the striatum. The combination of three markers was sufficient to obtain a 95\% global accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for discriminating patients with Parkinson’s disease from controls. The markers comprising discriminating combinations were R2* in the substantia nigra, fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra and mean diffusivity in the putamen or caudate nucleus. Remarkably, the predictive markers involved the nigrostriatal structures that characterize Parkinson’s physiopathology. Furthermore, highly discriminating combinations included markers from three different magnetic resonance parameters (R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy). These findings demonstrate that multimodal magnetic resonance imaging of subcortical grey matter structures is useful for the evaluation of Parkinson’s disease and, possibly, of other subcortical pathologies.},

	abstract = {One of the most common monogenic forms of Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by mutations in the LRRK2 gene that encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2 mutations, and particularly the most common mutation Gly2019Ser, are observed in patients with autosomal dominant PD and in those with apparent sporadic PD, who are clinically indistinguishable from those with idiopathic PD. The discoveries that pathogenic mutations in the LRRK2 gene increase LRRK2 kinase activity and that small-molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors can be neuroprotective in preclinical models of PD have placed LRRK2 at the centre of disease modification efforts in PD. Recent investigations also suggest that LRRK2 has a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD and that LRRK2 therapies might, therefore, be beneficial in this common subtype of PD. In this Review, we describe the characteristics of LRRK2-associated PD that are most relevant to the development of LRRK2-targeted therapies and the design and implementation of clinical trials. We highlight strategies for correcting the effects of mutations in the LRRK2 gene, focusing on how to identify which patients are the optimal candidates and how to decide on the timing of such trials. In addition, we discuss challenges in implementing trials of disease-modifying treatment in people who carry LRRK2 mutations.},

	abstract = {Classical accounts of the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease have emphasized degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with consequent dysfunction of cortico–striatal–thalamic loops. In contrast, post-mortem studies indicate that pathological changes in Parkinson’s disease (Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. The nigrostriatal and histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they do emphasize different anatomical structures. To address the question of which brain structures are functionally most affected by Parkinson’s disease, we performed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study focused on striatal functional connectivity. We contrasted 13 patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease versus 19 age-matched control subjects, using methodology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of head motion during scanning. The principal finding in the Parkinson’s disease group was markedly lower striatal correlations with thalamus, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. This result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease. Focally altered functional connectivity also was observed in sensori-motor and visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. Striatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was graded (posterior putamen \&gt; anterior putamen \&gt; caudate), in both patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects, in a manner that corresponds to well-documented gradient of striatal dopaminergic function loss in Parkinson’s disease. We hypothesize that this gradient provides a clue to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.},

	abstract = {See Nieuwhof and Helmich (doi:10.1093/brain/awx267) for a scientific commentary on this article.Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Previous studies measuring spontaneous brain activity using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging have reported abnormal changes in broadly distributed whole-brain networks. Although resting state functional connectivity, estimating temporal correlations between brain regions, is measured with the assumption that intrinsic fluctuations throughout the scan are stable, dynamic changes of functional connectivity have recently been suggested to reflect aspects of functional capacity of neural systems, and thus may serve as biomarkers of disease. The present work is the first study to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity in patients with Parkinson’s disease, with a focus on the temporal properties of functional connectivity states as well as the variability of network topological organization using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-one Parkinson’s disease patients and 23 healthy controls were studied using group spatial independent component analysis, a sliding windows approach, and graph-theory methods. The dynamic functional connectivity analyses suggested two discrete connectivity configurations: a more frequent, sparsely connected within-network state (State I) and a less frequent, more strongly interconnected between-network state (State II). In patients with Parkinson’s disease, the occurrence of the sparsely connected State I dropped by 12.62\%, while the expression of the more strongly interconnected State II increased by the same amount. This was consistent with the altered temporal properties of the dynamic functional connectivity characterized by a shortening of the dwell time of State I and by a proportional increase of the dwell time pattern in State II. These changes are suggestive of a reduction in functional segregation among networks and are correlated with the clinical severity of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Additionally, there was a higher variability in the network global efficiency, suggesting an abnormal global integration of the brain networks. The altered functional segregation and abnormal global integration in brain networks confirmed the vulnerability of functional connectivity networks in Parkinson’s disease.},

	abstract = {The substantia nigra contains dopaminergic cells that project to the striatum and are affected by the neurodegenerative process that appears in Parkinson's disease (PD). For accurate differential diagnosis and for disease monitoring the availability of a sensitive and non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease would be essential. Although there has been notable progress in studying correlates of nigral degeneration by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the past decade, MRI and analysis techniques that allow accurate high-resolution mapping of the SN within a clinically acceptable acquisition time are still elusive. The main purpose of the preliminary study was to evaluate the potential role of the driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) method for delineation of the SN and differentiation of PD patients from healthy control subjects (n=10 in each group). We also investigated whether additional measures that can be obtained with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can further improve the MRI-guided discrimination between PD patients and controls. Our results show that the DESPOT1 method allows for a clear visualisation of the SN as a whole. Volumetric comparisons between ten PD patients and ten healthy subjects revealed significantly smaller volumes in patients for both the left and the right sides when the whole SN was considered. Combining SN volumetry and its connectivity with the thalamus improved the classification sensitivity to 100\% and specificity to 80\% for PD (discriminant function analysis with leave-one-out cross validation). Combining DESPOT1 imaging and DTI could therefore serve as a diagnostic marker for idiopathic Parkinson's disease in the future.},

Weaknesses include several ambiguities in the written text, inadequate instructions for raters, some metric flaws, and the absence of screening questions on several important non-motor aspects of PD. The Task Force recommends that the MDS sponsor the development of a new version of the UPDRS and encourage efforts to establish its clinimetric properties, especially addressing the need to define a Minimal Clinically Relevant Difference and a Minimal Clinically Relevant Incremental Difference, as well as testing its correlation with the current UPDRS. If developed, the new scale should be culturally unbiased and be tested in different racial, gender, and age-groups. Future goals should include the definition of UPDRS scores with confidence intervals that correlate with clinically pertinent designations, “minimal,” “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” PD. Whereas the presence of non-motor components of PD can be identified with screening questions, a new version of the UPDRS should include an official appendix that includes other, more detailed, and optionally used scales to determine severity of these impairments. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society},

Despite several systematic reviews having summarised the evidence on diagnostic accuracy, the impact of imaging results on clinical utility has not been systematically assessed. Our objective was to examine the available evidence on the clinical utility of DaTscan imaging in changing diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with suspected PS. We performed a systematic review of published studies of clinical utility from 2000 to 2019 without language restrictions. A meta-analysis of change in diagnosis and management rates reported from each study was performed using a random-effects model and logit transformation. Sub-group analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was performed to explore heterogeneity. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen of these contributed to the meta-analyses including 950 and 779 patients with a reported change in management and change in diagnosis, respectively. The use of DaTscan imaging resulted in a change in management in 54\% (95\% CI: 47–61\%) of patients. Change in diagnosis occurred in 31\% (95\% CI: 22–42\%) of patients. The two pooled analyses were characterised by high levels of heterogeneity. Our systematic review and meta-analysis show that imaging with DaTscan was associated with a change in management in approximately half the patients tested and the diagnosis was modified in one third. Regardless of time from symptom onset to scan results, these changes were consistent. Further research focusing on specific patient subgroups could provide additional evidence on the impact on clinical outcomes.},

Dopamine transporter (DaT)-spectral positron emission computed tomography is widely used for capturing functional nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. However, it does not reflect other ongoing neuronal processes; especially in the prodromal stages of the disease. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been proposed as a mode for assessing functional alterations associated with PD, but its relation to dopaminergic deficiency remains unclear. We aimed to study the association between presynaptic striatal dopamine uptake and functional connectivity (FC) patterns among healthy first-degree relatives of PD patients with mutations in LRRK2 and GBA genes. N = 85 healthy first-degree subjects were enrolled and genotyped. All participants underwent DaT and rs-fMRI scans, as well as a comprehensive clinical assessment battery. Between-group differences in FC within striatal regions were investigated and compared with striatal binding ratios (SBR). N = 26 GBA-NMCs, N = 25 LRRK2-NMCs, and N = 34 age-matched nonmanifesting noncarriers (NM-NCs) were included in each study group based on genetic status. While genetically-defined groups were similar across clinical measures, LRRK2-NMCs demonstrated lower SBR in the right putamen compared with NM-NCs, and higher right putamen FC compared to GBA-NMCs. In this group, higher striatal FC was associated with increased risk for PD. The observed differential SBR and FC patterns among LRRK2-NMCs and GBA-NMCs indicate that DaTscan and FC assessments might offer a more sensitive prediction of the risk for PD in the pre-clinical stages of the disease.},

Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in five countries and three continents, which is still growing.},

	abstract = {Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy – Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) are often represented by similar clinical symptoms, which may challenge diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare regional cerebral diffusion properties in PD and PSP-RS subjects and evaluate the use of these metrics for an automatic classification framework.
Material and methods
Diffusion-tensor MRI datasets from 52 PD and 21 PSP-RS subjects were employed for this study. Using an atlas-based approach, regional median values of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were measured and employed for feature selection using RELIEFF and subsequent classification using a support vector machine.
Results
According to RELIEFF, the top 17 diffusion values consisting of deep gray matter structures, the brainstem, and frontal cortex were found to be especially informative for an automatic classification. A MANCOVA analysis performed on these diffusion values as dependent variables revealed that PSP-RS and PD subjects differ significantly (p {\textless} .001). Generally, PSP-RS subjects exhibit reduced FA, and increased MD, RD, and AD values in nearly all brain structures analyzed compared to PD subjects. The leave-one-out cross-validation of the support vector machine classifier revealed that the classifier can differentiate PD and PSP-RS subjects with an accuracy of 87.7\%. More precisely, six PD subjects were wrongly classified as PSP-RS and three PSP-RS subjects were wrongly classified as PD.
Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that PSP-RS subjects exhibit widespread and more severe diffusion alterations compared to PD patients, which appears valuable for an automatic computer-aided diagnosis approach.},

The most successful of these methods have two phases that are alternated for a certain number of global iterations. The first phase generates a solution and the second seeks to improve the outcome. Each global iteration produces a solution that is typically a local optimum, and the best overall solution is the output of the algorithm. The interaction between the two phases creates a balance between search diversification (structural variation) and search intensification (improvement), to yield an effective means for generating high-quality solutions. This survey briefly sketches historical developments that have motivated the field, and then focuses on modern contributions that define the current state-of-the-art. We consider two categories of multi-start methods: memory-based and memoryless procedures. The former are based on identifying and recording specific types of information (attributes) to exploit in future constructions. The latter are based on order statistics of sampling and generate unconnected solutions. An interplay between the features of these two categories provides an inviting area for future exploration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Inter-modality covariation leveraged as a scientific principle can inform the development of novel hypotheses and increase statistical power in the analysis of diverse data. We present similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR), an algorithm that exploits inter-modality relationships to transform large scientific datasets into smaller, more well-powered and intepretable low-dimensional spaces. Novel aspects of this methodology include its objective function for identifying joint signal, an efficient approach based on sparse matrices for representing prior within-modality relationships and an efficient implementation that allows SiMLR to be applied to relatively large datasets with multiple modalities, each of which may have millions of entries. We first describe and contextualize SiMLR theory and implementation strategies. We then illustrate the method in simulated data to establish its expected performance. Subsequently, we demonstrate succinct SiMLR case studies, and compare with related methods, in publicly accessible example datasets. Lastly, we use SiMLR to derive a neurobiological embedding from three types of measurements - two measurements from structural neuroimaging complemented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 44 depression and anxiety-related loci [1]. We find that, in a validation dataset, the low-dimensional space from the training set exhibits above-chance relationships with clinical measurements of anxiety and, to a lesser degree, depression. The results suggest that SiMLR is able to derive a low-dimensional representation space that, in suitable datasets, may be clinically relevant. Taken together, this collection of results shows that SiMLR may be applied with default parameters to joint signal estimation from disparate modalities and may yield practically useful results.},

	abstract = {Importance: Corticolimbic patterns of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation define neuropathologic subtypes of Alzheimer disease (AD), which underlie the clinical heterogeneity observed antemortem. The cholinergic system, which is the target of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy, is selectively vulnerable in AD. Objective: To investigate the major source of cholinergic innervation, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), in order to determine whether there is differential involvement of NFT accumulation or neuronal loss among AD subtypes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, retrospective abstraction of clinical records and quantitative assessment of NFTs and neuron counts in the nbM was completed in January 2019 at the Mayo Clinic using the Florida Autopsied Multi-Ethnic (FLAME) cohort, which had been accessioned from 1991 until 2015. The FLAME cohort is derived from the deeded autopsy program funded throughout the State of Florida's memory disorder clinic referral services. Of the 2809 consecutively accessioned FLAME cohort, 1464 were identified as neuropathologically diagnosed AD cases and nondemented normal controls available for clinicopathologic assessment. Quantification of NFTs and neuronal density in the anterior nbM was performed blinded to neuropathologic groupings. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic and clinical characteristics, including cognitive decline measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination score (range, 0-30), were evaluated. The anterior nbM was investigated quantitatively for neuronal loss and NFT accumulation. Results: In total, 1361 AD subtypes and 103 nondemented controls were assessed. The median (interquartile range) age at death was 72 (66-80) years in hippocampal sparing (HpSp) AD, 81 (76-86) years in typical AD, and 86 (82-90) years in limbic predominant AD. The median (interquartile range) count per 0.125 mm2 of thioflavin S-positive NFTs was highest in the nbM of HpSp AD (14 [9-20]; n = 163), lower in typical AD (10 [5-16]; n = 937), and lowest in limbic predominant AD (8 [5-11], n = 163) (P {\textbackslash}textless.001). The median (interquartile range) neuronal density per millimeters squared was lowest in HpSp AD cases (22 [17-28]; n = 148), higher in typical AD (25 [19-30]; n = 727), and highest in limbic predominant AD (26 [19-32]; n = 127) (P =.002). Multivariable regression modeling of clinical and demographic variables was performed to assess overlap in NFT accumulation and neuronal density differences among AD subtypes. Higher NFT accumulation in the nbM was associated with younger age at onset for HpSp AD (β, -1.5; 95\% CI, -2.9 to -0.15; P =.03) and typical AD (β, -3.2; 95\% CI, -3.9 to -2.4; P {\textbackslash}textless.001). In addition, higher NFT accumulation in the nbM of typical AD cases was associated with female sex (β, 2.5; 95\% CI, 1.4-3.5; P {\textbackslash}textless.001), apolipoprotein E ϵ4 allele (β, 1.3; 95\% CI, 0.15-2.5; P =.03), and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (β, -1.8; 95\% CI, -3.2 to -0.31; P =.02). Demographic and clinical progression variables were not associated with NFT accumulation in the nbM of limbic predominant AD cases. Conclusions and Relevance: These data provide supportive evidence that NFT accumulation in the nbM may underlie more widespread and severe cholinergic deficits in young-onset AD, in particular in patients with HpSp AD. Moreover, these findings underscore the importance of considering age at onset, sex, and apolipoprotein E genotype when assessing outcomes in AD.},

However, the intrinsic process of the human brain structural network evolving from iRBD to PD still remains largely unknown. To address this issue, 151 participants including iRBD, PD and age-matched normal controls were recruited to receive diffusion MRI scans and neuropsychological examinations. The connectome-wide association analysis was performed to detect reorganization of brain structural network along with PD progression. Eight brain seed regions in both cortical and subcortical areas demonstrated significant structural pattern changes along with the progression of PD. Applying machine learning on the key connectivity related to these seed regions demonstrated better classification accuracy compared to conventional network-based statistic. Our study shows that connectome-wide association analysis reveals the underlying structural connectivity patterns related to the progression of PD, and provide a promising distinct capability to predict prodromal PD patients.},

A recent article by Xing \& Qiu (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33(10):2081-2092, 2011) is based on an inappropriately narrow conceptualization of the image registration problem as the task of making two images look alike, which disregards whether the established spatial correspondence is plausible. The authors propose a new algorithm, Nonparametric Local Smoothing (NLS) for image registration, but use image similarities alone as a measure of registration performance, although these measures do not relate reliably to the realism of the correspondence map. Results: Using data obtained from its authors, we show experimentally that the method proposed by Xing \& Qiu is not an effective registration algorithm. While it optimizes image similarity, it does not compute accurate, interpretable transformations. Even judged by image similarity alone, the proposed method is consistently outperformed by a simple pixel permutation algorithm, which is known by design not to compute valid registrations. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that the NLS algorithm proposed recently for image registration, and published in one of the most respected journals in computer science, is not, in fact, an effective registration method at all. Our results also emphasize the general need to apply registration evaluation criteria that are sensitive to whether correspondences are accurate and mappings between images are physically interpretable. These goals cannot be achieved by simply reporting image similarities. © 2012 Rohlfing and Avants; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that cortical and hippocampal volumes, measured in vivo from volumetric MRI (vMRI) scans, could be used to identify variant subtypes of Alzheimer disease (AD) and to prospectively predict the rate of clinical decline. Methods: Amyloid-positive participants with AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1 and ADNI2 with baseline MRI scans (n = 229) and 2-year clinical follow-up (n = 100) were included. AD subtypes (hippocampal sparing [HpSpMRI], limbic predominant [LPMRI], typical AD [tADMRI]) were defined according to an algorithm analogous to one recently proposed for tau neuropathology. Relationships between baseline hippocampal volume to cortical volume ratio (HV:CTV) and clinical variables were examined by both continuous regression and categorical models. Results: When participants were divided categorically, the HpSpMRI group showed significantly more AD-like hypometabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) and poorer baseline executive function (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Other baseline clinical measures did not differ across the 3 groups. Participants with HpSpMRI also showed faster subsequent clinical decline than participants with LPMRI on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, 13-Item Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (all p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) and tADMRI on the MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) (both p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Finally, a larger HV:CTV was associated with poorer baseline executive function and a faster slope of decline in CDR-SB, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog13 score (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). These associations were driven mostly by the amount of cortical rather than hippocampal atrophy. Conclusions: AD subtypes with phenotypes consistent with those observed with tau neuropathology can be identified in vivo with vMRI. An increased HV:CTV ratio was predictive of faster clinical decline in participants with AD who were clinically indistinguishable at baseline except for a greater dysexecutive presentation.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning from natural image to medical image has established as one of the most practical paradigms in deep learning for medical image analysis. However, to fit this paradigm, 3D imaging tasks in the most prominent imaging modalities (e.g., CT and MRI) have to be reformulated and solved in 2D, losing rich 3D anatomical information and inevitably compromising the performance. To overcome this limitation, we have built a set of models, called Generic Autodidactic Models, nicknamed Models Genesis, because they are created ex nihilo (with no manual labeling), self-taught (learned by self-supervision), and generic (served as source models for generating application-specific target models). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our Models Genesis significantly outperform learning from scratch in all five target 3D applications covering both segmentation and classification. More importantly, learning a model from scratch simply in 3D may not necessarily yield performance better than transfer learning from ImageNet in 2D, but our Models Genesis consistently top any 2D approaches including fine-tuning the models pre-trained from ImageNet as well as fine-tuning the 2D versions of our Models Genesis, confirming the importance of 3D anatomical information and significance of our Models Genesis for 3D medical imaging. This performance is attributed to our unified self-supervised learning framework, built on a simple yet powerful observation: the sophisticated yet recurrent anatomy in medical images can serve as strong supervision signals for deep models to learn common anatomical representation automatically via self-supervision. As open science, all pre-trained Models Genesis are available at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/ModelsGenesis.},

This framework relies on a new version of regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) where various scheme functions and shrinkage constants are considered. Two types of between block connections are considered: blocks are either fully connected or connected to the superblock (concatenation of all blocks). The proposed iterative algorithm is monotone convergent and guarantees obtaining at convergence a stationary point of RGCCA. In some cases, the solution of RGCCA is the first eigenvalue/eigenvector of a certain matrix. For the scheme functions x, {\textbar} x{\textbar} , x2 or x4 and shrinkage constants 0 or 1, many multiblock component methods are recovered.},

At POST3, lobar air volume increased 83-148\% and tissue (including microvascular blood) volume 120-234\% above PRE values without further changes at POST15. Lobar-specific compliance (Cs) increased 52-137\% from PRE to POST3 and 28-79\% from POST3 to POST15. Inflation-related parenchyma strain and shear were estimated by detailed registration of corresponding anatomical features at each Ptp. Within each lobe, regional displacement was most pronounced at the caudal region, whereas strain was pronounced in the periphery. Regional three-dimensional strain magnitudes increased heterogeneously from PRE to POST3, with further medial-lateral increases from POST3 to POST15. Lobar principal strains (PSs) were unchanged or modestly elevated postresection; changes in lobar maximum PS correlated inversely with changes in lobar air and tissue volumes. Lobar shear distortion increased in coronal and transverse planes at POST3 without further changes thereafter. These results establish a novel use of functional HRCT to map heterogeneous regional deformation during compensatory lung growth and illustrate a stimulus-response feedback loop whereby postresection mechanical stress initiates differential lobar regrowth and sustained remodeling, which in turn, relieves parenchyma stress and strain, resulting in progressive increases in lobar Cs and a delayed increase in whole lung Cs.},

	abstract = {While many neuroscience questions aim to understand the human brain, much current knowledge has been gained using animal models, which replicate genetic, structural, and connectivity aspects of the human brain. While voxel-based analysis (VBA) of preclinical magnetic resonance images is widely-used, a thorough examination of the statistical robustness, stability, and error rates is hindered by high computational demands of processing large arrays, and the many parameters involved. Thus, workflows are often based on intuition or experience, while preclinical validation studies remain scarce. To increase throughput and reproducibility of quantitative small animal brain studies, we have developed a publicly shared, high throughput VBA pipeline in a high-performance computing environment, called SAMBA. The increased computational efficiency allowed large multidimensional arrays to be processed in 1-3 days-a task that previously took ∼1 month. To quantify the variability and reliability of preclinical VBA in rodent models, we propose a validation framework consisting of morphological phantoms, and four metrics. This addresses several sources that impact VBA results, including registration and template construction strategies. We have used this framework to inform the VBA workflow parameters in a VBA study for a mouse model of epilepsy. We also present initial efforts towards standardizing small animal neuroimaging data in a similar fashion with human neuroimaging. We conclude that verifying the accuracy of VBA merits attention, and should be the focus of a broader effort within the community. The proposed framework promotes consistent quality assurance of VBA in preclinical neuroimaging; facilitating the creation and communication of robust results.},

In this paper, we consider transfer learning via dimensionality reduction. To solve this problem, we learn a low-dimensional latent feature space where the distributions between the source do-main data and the target domain data are the same or close to each other. Onto this latent feature space, we project the data in related domains where we can ap-ply standard learning algorithms to train classification or regression models. Thus, the latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new di-mensionality reduction method to find a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions of the data in different domains in a latent space. The ef-fectiveness of our approach to transfer learning is veri-fied by experiments in two real world applications: in-door WiFi localization and binary text classification.},

The method combines multi-atlas segmentation, similarity-weighted voting, and a novel learning-based bias correction technique to achieve excellent agreement with manual segmentation. Initial partitioning of MRI slices into hippocampal 'head', 'body' and 'tail' slices is the only input required from the user, necessitated by the nature of the underlying segmentation protocol. Dice overlap between manual and automatic segmentation is above 0.87 for the larger subfields, CA1 and dentate gyrus, and is competitive with the best results for whole-hippocampus segmentation in the literature. Intraclass correlation of volume measurements in CA1 and dentate gyrus is above 0.89. Overlap in smaller hippocampal subfields is lower in magnitude (0.54 for CA2, 0.62 for CA3, 0.77 for subiculum and 0.79 for entorhinal cortex) but comparable to overlap between manual segmentations by trained human raters.

Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	abstract = {The present study examined the organization of complex familiar activities, known as "scripts" (e.g., "going fishing"). We assessed whether events in a script are processed in a linear-sequential manner or clustered-hierarchical manner, and we evaluated the neural basis for this processing capacity. Converging evidence was obtained from functional neuroimaging in healthy young adults and from behavioral and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in patients with focal neurodegenerative disease. In both studies, participants judged the order of consecutive event pairs taken from a script. Event pairs either were clustered together within a script or were from different clusters within the script. Controls judged events more accurately and quickly if taken from the same cluster within a script compared with different clusters, even though all event pairs were consecutive, consistent with the hierarchical organization of a script. Functional magnetic resonance imaging associated this with bilateral inferior frontal activation. Patients with progressive nonfluent aphasia or behavior-variant frontotemporal dementia did not distinguish between event pairs from the same cluster or from different clusters within a script. Structural MRI associated this deficit with significant frontal cortical atrophy. Our findings suggest that frontal cortex contributes to clustering events during script comprehension, underlining the role of frontal cortex in the hierarchical organization of a script. © The Authors 2010.},

However, there are many registration algorithms to choose from. A recent evaluation of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods, as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than 16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels, registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following: 1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration; and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods using present resampling methods. From the results of this study, we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template. © 2010.},

Objective: To investigate the relationship between midbrain nuclei volume as an in vivo biomarker for surviving neurons in mild-to-moderate patients using 7.0 Tesla MRI. Methods: We performed ultra-high resolution quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) on the midbrain in 32 PD participants with less than 10 years duration and 8 healthy controls. Following blinded manual segmentation, the individual volumes of the SN, subthalamic nucleus, and red nucleus were measured. We then determined the associations between the midbrain nuclei and clinical metrics (age, disease duration, MDS-UPDRS motor score, and subscores for bradykinesia/rigidity, tremor, and postural instability/gait difficulty). Results: We found that smaller SN correlated with longer disease duration (r =-0.49, p = 0.004), more severe MDS-UPDRS motor score (r =-0.42, p = 0.016), and more severe bradykinesia-rigidity subscore (r =-0.47, p = 0.007), but not tremor or postural instability/gait difficulty subscores. In a hemi-body analysis, bradykinesia-rigidity severity only correlated with SN contralateral to the less-affected hemi-body, and not contralateral to the more-affected hemi-body, possibly reflecting the greatest change in dopamine neuron loss early in disease. Multivariate generalized estimating equation model confirmed that bradykinesia-rigidity severity, age, and disease duration, but not tremor severity, predicted SN volume. Conclusions: In mild-to-moderate PD, SN volume relates to motor manifestations in a motor domain-specific and laterality-dependent manner. Non-invasive in vivo 7.0 Tesla QSM may serve as a biomarker in longitudinal studies of SN atrophy and in studies of people at risk for developing PD.},

Experimental Design: A comprehensive database of 3,748 patients including previously reported clinical prognostic factors was established by pooling patient-level data from clinical trials. Following quality control and standardization, descriptive statistics were generated. Univariate analyses were conducted using proportional hazards models. Multivariable analysis using a log-logistic model stratified by center and multivariable fractional polynomials was conducted to identify independent predictors of survival. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation methods. Three risk groups were formed using the 25th and 75th percentiles of the resulting prognostic index. The model was validated using an independent data set of 645 patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Results: Median survival in the favorable, intermediate and poor risk groups was 26.9 months, 11.5 months, and 4.2 months, respectively. Factors contributing to the prognostic index included treatment, performance status, number of metastatic sites, time from diagnosis to treatment, and pretreatment hemoglobin, white blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and serum calcium. The model showed good concordance when tested among patients treated with TKI therapy (C statistic=0.741, 95\% CI: 0.714-0.768).

Data from 1896 animals with both phenotypic and genotypic (12 320 loci) information were used for the analysis. Missing genotypes were imputed based on estimated allelic frequencies, with no attempt to reconstruct haplotypes based on family information or linkage disequilibrium between markers. A feed-forward multilayer perceptron network consisting of a single output layer and one hidden layer was used. Training of the neural network was done using the Bayesian regularized backpropagation algorithm. When the number of neurons in the hidden layer was increased, the number of effective parameters, γ, increased up to a point and stabilized thereafter. A model with five neurons in the hidden layer produced a value of γ that saturated the data. In terms of predictive ability, a network with five neurons in the hidden layer attained the smallest error and highest correlation in the test data although differences among networks were negligible. Using inherent weight information of BRANN with different number of neurons in the hidden layer, it was observed that 17 SNPs had a larger impact on the network, indicating their possible relevance in prediction of BMI. It is concluded that BRANN may be at least as useful as other methods for high-dimensional genome-enabled prediction, with the advantage of its potential ability of capturing non-linear relationships, which may be useful in the study of quantitative traits under complex gene action. © Cambridge University Press 2011.},

Clinical diagnosis of PIGD may be challenging for the general neurologist. Purpose: To evaluate 1) the utility of a fully automated volume-based morphometry (Vol-BM) in characterizing imaging diagnostic markers in PD and PIGD, including, 2) novel deep gray nuclear lesion load (GMab), and 3) discriminatory performance of a Vol-BM model construct in classifying the PIGD subtype. Study Type: Prospective. Subjects: In all, 23 PIGD, 21 PD, and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC) underwent MRI brain scans and clinical assessments. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T, sagittal 3D-magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging (FLAIR) sequences. Assessment: Clinical assessment was conducted by a movement disorder neurologist. The MR brain images were then segmented using an automated multimodal Vol-BM algorithm (MorphoBox) and reviewed by two authors independently. Statistical Testing: Brain segmentation and clinical parameter differences and dependence were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to differentiate PIGD from PD, and discriminative reliability was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Significantly higher white matter lesion load (WMab) (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01), caudate GMab (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05), and lateral and third ventricular (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) volumetry were found in PIGD, compared with PD and HC. WMab, caudate and putamen GMab, and caudate, lateral, and third ventricular volumetry showed significant coefficients (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.005) in linear regressions with balance and gait assessments in both patient groups. A model incorporating WMab, caudate GMab, and caudate GM discriminated PIGD from PD and HC with a sensitivity = 0.83 and specificity = 0.76 (AUC = 0.84). Data Conclusion: Fast, unbiased quantification of microstructural brain changes in PD and PIGD is feasible using automated Vol-BM. Composite lesion load in the white matter and caudate, and caudate volumetry discriminated PIGD from PD and HC, and showed potential in classification of these disorders using supervised machine learning.

Therefore, we have developed intNMF, an integrative approach for disease subtype classification based on non-negative matrix factorization. The proposed approach carries out integrative clustering of multiple high dimensional molecular data in a single comprehensive analysis utilizing the information across multiple biological levels assessed on the same individual.

While ICA has been successfully applied to single-subject analysis, the extension of ICA to group inferences is not straightforward and remains an active topic of research. Current group ICA models, such as the GIFT [Calhoun, V.D., Adali, T., Pearlson, G.D., Pekar, J.J., 2001. A method for making group inferences from functional MRI data using independent component analysis. Hum. Brain Mapp. 14, 140-151.] and tensor PICA [Beckmann, C.F., Smith, S.M., 2005. Tensorial extensions of independent component analysis for multisubject FMRI analysis.

To our knowledge, there are currently no methods for assessing the validity of different model structures in real fMRI data and selecting the most appropriate one among various choices. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for estimating and comparing group ICA models with varying spatio-temporal structures. We consider a class of group ICA models that can accommodate different group structures and include existing models, such as the GIFT and tensor PICA, as special cases. We propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach with a modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the estimation of the proposed class of models. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) are presented to compare between different group ICA models. The LRT can be used to perform model comparison and selection, to assess the goodness-of-fit of a model in a particular data set, and to test group differences in the fMRI signal time courses between subject subgroups. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under varying structures of group spatio-temporal processes. We illustrate our group ICA method using data from an fMRI study that investigates changes in neural processing associated with the regular practice of Zen meditation.},

	abstract = {Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common symptom in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Previous studies have reported relationships between FOG, substantia nigra (SN) degeneration, dopamine transporter (DAT) concentration, as well as amyloid β deposition. However, there is a paucity of research on the concurrent impact of white matter damage. Objectives: To assess the inter-relationships between these different co-morbidities, their impact on future FOG and whether they act independently of each other. Methods: We used baseline MRI and longitudinal gait data from 423 de novo PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We used deformation based morphometry (DBM) from T1-weighted MRI to measure SN atrophy, and segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) as a measure of WM pathological load. Putamen and caudate DAT levels from SPECT as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid β were obtained directly from the PPMI. Following correlation analyses, we investigated whether WMH burden mediates the impact of amyloid β on future FOG. Results: SN DBM, WMH load, putamen and caudate DAT activity and CSF amyloid β levels were significantly different between PD patients with and without future FOG (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.008). Mediation analysis demonstrated an effect of CSF amyloid β levels on future FOG via WMH load, independent of SN atrophy and striatal DAT activity levels. Conclusions: Amyloid β might impact future FOG in PD patients through an increase in WMH burden, in a pathway independent of Lewy body pathology.},

	abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) has become an increasingly utilized approach for analyzing brain imaging data. In contrast to the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user to parameterize the data (e.g. the brain's response to stimuli), ICA, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response. In addition, ICA is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. There are a wide variety of ICA approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software. In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials. As demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ICA is a powerful and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain.},

	abstract = {Sophisticated image analysis methods have been developed for the human brain, but such tools still need to be adapted and optimized for quantitative small animal imaging. We propose a framework for quantitative anatomical phenotyping in mouse models of neurological and psychiatric conditions. The framework encompasses an atlas space, image acquisition protocols, and software tools to register images into this space. We show that a suite of segmentation tools (Avants, Epstein et al., 2008) designed for human neuroimaging can be incorporated into a pipeline for segmenting mouse brain images acquired with multispectral magnetic resonance imaging (MR) protocols. We present a flexible approach for segmenting such hyperimages, optimizing registration, and identifying optimal combinations of image channels for particular structures. Brain imaging with T1, T2* and T2 contrasts yielded accuracy in the range of 83\% for hippocampus and caudate putamen (Hc and CPu), but only 54\% in white matter tracts, and 44\% for the ventricles. The addition of diffusion tensor parameter images improved accuracy for large gray matter structures (by {\textbackslash}textgreater5\%), white matter (10\%), and ventricles (15\%). The use of Markov random field segmentation further improved overall accuracy in the C57BL/6 strain by 6\%; so Dice coefficients for Hc and CPu reached 93\%, for white matter 79\%, for ventricles 68\%, and for substantia nigra 80\%. We demonstrate the segmentation pipeline for the widely used C57BL/6 strain, and two test strains (BXD29, APP/TTA). This approach appears promising for characterizing temporal changes in mouse models of human neurological and psychiatric conditions, and may provide anatomical constraints for other preclinical imaging, e.g. fMRI and molecular imaging. This is the first demonstration that multiple MR imaging modalities combined with multivariate segmentation methods lead to significant improvements in anatomical segmentation in the mouse brain. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Since its introduction in 2014, the face morphing forgery (FMF) attack has received significant attention from the biometric and media forensic research communities. The attack aims at creating artificially weakened templates which can be successfully matched against multiple persons. If successful, the attack has an immense impact on many biometric authentication scenarios including the application of electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD) at automated border control gates. We extend the StirTrace framework for benchmarking FMF attacks by adding five issues: a novel threefold definition for the quality of morphed images, a novel FMF realisation (combined morphing), a post-processing operation to simulate the digital image format used in eMRTD (passport scaling 15 kB), an automated face recognition system (VGG face descriptor) as additional means for biometric quality assessment and two feature spaces for FMF detection (keypoint features and fusion of keypoint and Benford features) as additional means for forensic quality assessment. We show that the impact of StirTrace post-processing operations on the biometric quality of morphed face images is negligible except for two noise operators and passport scaling 15 kB, the impact on the forensic quality depends on the type of post-processing, and the new FMF realisation outperforms the previously considered ones.},

Here we present the largest ever worldwide study by the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Major Depressive Disorder Working Group on cortical structural alterations in MDD. Structural T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 2148 MDD patients and 7957 healthy controls were analysed with harmonized protocols at 20 sites around the world. To detect consistent effects of MDD and its modulators on cortical thickness and surface area estimates derived from MRI, statistical effects from sites were meta-analysed separately for adults and adolescents. Adults with MDD had thinner cortical gray matter than controls in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior and posterior cingulate, insula and temporal lobes (Cohen's d effect sizes: -0.10 to -0.14). These effects were most pronounced in first episode and adult-onset patients ({\textbackslash}textgreater21 years). Compared to matched controls, adolescents with MDD had lower total surface area (but no differences in cortical thickness) and regional reductions in frontal regions (medial OFC and superior frontal gyrus) and primary and higher-order visual, somatosensory and motor areas (d: -0.26 to -0.57). The strongest effects were found in recurrent adolescent patients. This highly powered global effort to identify consistent brain abnormalities showed widespread cortical alterations in MDD patients as compared to controls and suggests that MDD may impact brain structure in a highly dynamic way, with different patterns of alterations at different stages of life.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 3 May 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.60.},

	abstract = {Recent development of technologies has made it easy to obtain a large amount of multi-view biomedical data from different sources or different preprocessing methods, such as the genome-wide data or electroencephalography (EEG) data. Multi-view intact space learning (MISL), which integrates the complementary information from multiple views to discover a latent intact representation of the data, has shown to be effective in computer vision and data mining tasks. However, it fails in biomedical data analysis since it loses geometric information when projecting data from the original space to the intact space. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-view intact space learning with geodesic similarity preserving (MISL-GSP). The method first builds one KNN graph for each view and then constructs a geodesic distance matrix that provides a suitable and noise-free similarity for characterizing the intra-view proximity. Based on the geodesic distance matrix, the average similarity among all the views can be obtained, which is used in the manifold regularization term of the multi-view intact space learning for preserving the geodesic similarity. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including the clustering experiments on 5 cancer datasets from the cancer genome atlas and the classification experiments on 1 EEG dataset.},

	issn = {1053-8119},
	abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (∼0.5mm×0.5mm), thick slices (∼2.0mm), and a field of view tailored to imaging the hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper) has been advanced as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal morphometry. Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived from HF-MRI has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (∼1mm3) T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort of healthy controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While measurements obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those obtained from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect of greater atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated minimum sample size required for detecting a 25\% change in patients' atrophy rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with a statistical power β=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample size was N=325. Using a dataset of test–retest scans, we show that the measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate that these results were not a confound of certain methodological choices made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making longitudinal measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest (ROI) around the HF to globally align serial images, followed by slice-by-slice deformable registration to measure local volume change. Additionally, we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements within hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences in atrophy rates were detected in several subfields.},

In addition, using cancer data from TCGA, we perform an extensive benchmark spanning ten different cancer types, providing the first systematic comparison of leading multi-omics and multi-view clustering algorithms. The results highlight key issues regarding the use of single- versus multi-omics, the choice of clustering strategy, the power of generic multi-view methods and the use of approximated p-values for gauging solution quality.

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the longitudinal repeatability and accuracy of cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements by using pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeled (pCASL) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in typically developing children. Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval with HIPAA compliance and informed consent were obtained. Twenty-two children aged 7-17 years underwent repeated pCASL examinations 2-4 weeks apart with a 3-T MR imager, along with in vivo blood T1 and arterial transit time measurements. Phase-contrast (PC) MR imaging was performed as the reference standard for global blood flow volume. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV) were used to evaluate accuracy and repeatability. Results: The accuracy of pCASL against the reference standard of PC MR imaging increased on incorporating subjectwise in vivo blood T1 measurement (ICC: 0.32 vs 0.58). The ICC further increased to 0.65 by using a population-based model of blood T1. Additionally, CBF measurements with use of pCASL demonstrated a moderate to good level of longitudinal repeatability in whole brain (ICC = 0.61, wsCV = 15\%), in gray matter (ICC = 0.65, wsCV = 14\%), and across 16 brain regions (mean ICC = 0.55, wsCV = 17\%). The mean arterial transit time was 1538 msec ± 123 (standard deviation) in the pediatric cohort studied, which showed an increasing trend with age (P = .043). Conclusion: Incorporating developmental changes in blood T1 is important for improving the accuracy of pCASL CBF measurements in children and adolescents; the noninvasive nature, accuracy, and longitudinal repeatability should facilitate the use of pCASL perfusion MR imaging in neurodevelopmental studies. © RSNA, 2012.},

	abstract = {Background: Pancreatic cancer (PaC) remains extremely lethal worldwide even after resection. PaC resection rates are low, making prognostic studies in resected PaC difficult. This large international population-based study aimed at exploring factors associated with survival in patients with resected TNM stage I-II PaC receiving chemotherapy and at developing and internationally validating a survival-predicting model. Methods: Data of stage I-II PaC patients resected and receiving chemotherapy in 2003-2014 were obtained from the national cancer registries of Belgium, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Norway, and the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-18 Program. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to investigate the associations of patient and tumor characteristics with overall survival, and analysis was performed in each country respectively without pooling. Prognostic factors remaining after backward selection in SEER-18 were used to build a nomogram, which was subjected to bootstrap internal validation and external validation using the European datasets. Results: A total of 11,837 resected PaC patients were analyzed, with median survival time of 18-23 months and 3-year survival rates of 21-31\%. In the main analysis, patient age, tumor T stage, N stage, and differentiation were associated with survival across most countries, with country-specific association patterns and strengths. However, tumor location was mostly not significantly associated with survival. Resection margin, hospital type, tumor size, positive and harvested lymph node number, lymph node ratio, and comorbidity number were associated with survival in certain countries where the information was available. A median survival time- and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival probability-predictive nomogram incorporating the backward-selected variables in the main analysis was established. It fits each European national cohort similarly well. Calibration curves showed very good agreement between nomogram-prediction and actual observation. The concordance index of the nomogram (0.60) was significantly higher than that of the T and N stage-based model (0.56) for predicting survival. Conclusions: In these large international population-based cohorts, patients with resected PaC receiving chemotherapy have distinct characteristics independently associated with survival, with country-specific patterns and strengths. A robust benchmark population-based survival-predicting model is established and internationally validated. Like previous models predicting survival in resected PaC, our nomogram performs modestly.},

Cocaine exposure may also lead to neonatal lesions in the caudate. However, long-term or latent effects of intrauterine cocaine exposure are rarely found. We use T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to quantify caudate nucleus morphology in matched control and exposed groups. The literature suggests that in utero cocaine exposure consequences in adolescents may be subtle, or masked by other variables. Our comparison focuses on contrasting the control group with high-exposure subjects (mothers who reported 2 median of 117 days of cocaine use during pregnancy; 82\% tested positive for cocaine use at term). We use advanced image registration and segmentation tools to quantify left and right caudate morphology.

	abstract = {In many multivariate statistical techniques, a set of linear functions of the original p variables is produced. One of the more difficult aspects of these techniques is the interpretation of the linear functions, as these functions usually have nonzero coefficients on all p variables. A common approach is to effectively ignore (treat as zero) any coefficients less than some threshold value, so that the function becomes simple and the interpretation becomes easier for the users. Such a procedure can be misleading. There are alternatives to principal component analysis which restrict the coefficients to a smaller number of possible values in the derivation of the linear functions, or replace the principal components by "principal variables." This article introduces a new technique, borrowing an idea proposed by Tibshirani in the context of multiple regression where similar problems arise in interpreting regression equations. This approach is the so-called LASSO, the "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator," in which a bound is introduced on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, and in which some coefficients consequently become zero. We explore some of the properties of the new technique, both theoretically and using simulation studies, and apply it to an example.},

Here a free-breathing myocardial ASL technique with the potential for reliable clinical application is presented, by combining ASL with a navigator-gated, electrocardiography-triggered TrueFISP readout sequence. Dynamic myocardial perfusion signals were measured at multiple delay times that allowed simultaneous fitting of myocardial blood flow and arterial transit time. With the assist of a nonrigid motion correction program, the estimated mean myocardial blood flow was 1.00 ± 0.55 mL/g/min with a mean transit time of ∼400 msec. The intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated scans was 0.89 with a mean within subject coefficient of variation of 22\%. Perfusion response during mild to moderate stress was further measured. The capability for noninvasive, free-breathing assessment of myocardial blood flow using ASL may offer an alternative approach to first-pass perfusion MRI for clinical evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The brain changes as we age and these changes are associated with functional deterioration and neurodegenerative disease. It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age' as a biomarker of an individual's brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age. Importantly, recent evidence shows that having an ‘older'-appearing brain relates to advanced physiological and cognitive ageing and the risk of mortality. We discuss controversies surrounding brain age and highlight emerging trends such as the use of multimodality neuroimaging and the employment of ‘deep learning' methods. Brain age can be predicted in individuals based on neuroimaging data using machine learning approaches to model trajectories of healthy brain ageing. The predicted brain age for a new individual can differ from his or her chronological age; this difference appears to reflect advanced or delayed brain ageing. Brain age has been shown to relate to cognitive ageing and multiple aspects of physiological ageing and to predict the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and mortality in older adults. Various diseases, including HIV, schizophrenia, and diabetes, have been shown to make the brain appear older. Further, brain age is being used to identify possible protective or deleterious factors for brain health as people age. Brain age is being actively developed to combine multiple measures of brain structure and function, capturing increasing amounts of detail on the ageing brain.},

It allows for the integration of domain knowledge and specific requirements. We demonstrate the flexible applicability and scalability of the method on large real world data sets.},

	abstract = {A major goal in neuroscience is to understand the neural pathways underlying human behavior. We introduce the recently developed Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) method to the neuroscience community to simultaneously analyze imaging and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project. Motivated by recent computational and theoretical improvements in the JIVE approach, we simultaneously explore the joint and individual variation between and within imaging and behavioral data. In particular, we demonstrate that JIVE is an effective and efficient approach for integrating task fMRI and behavioral variables using three examples: one example where task variation is strong, one where task variation is weak and a reference case where the behavior is not directly related to the image. These examples are provided to visualize the different levels of signal found in the joint variation including working memory regions in the image data and accuracy and response time from the in-task behavioral variables. Joint analysis provides insights not available from conventional single block decomposition methods such as Singular Value Decomposition. Additionally, the joint variation estimated by JIVE appears to more clearly identify the working memory regions than Partial Least Squares (PLS), while Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) gives grossly overfit results. The individual variation in JIVE captures the behavior unrelated signals such as a background activation that is spatially homogeneous and activation in the default mode network. The information revealed by this individual variation is not examined in traditional methods such as CCA and PLS. We suggest that JIVE can be used as an alternative to PLS and CCA to improve estimation of the signal common to two or more datasets and reveal novel insights into the signal unique to each dataset.},

	abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in regulating gene expression and therefore a broad range of biological processes and diseases. DNA methylation is tissue-specific, dynamic, sequence-context-dependent and trans-generationally heritable, and these complex patterns of methylation highlight the significance of profiling DNA methylation to answer biological questions. In this review, we surveyed major methylation assays, along with comparisons and biological examples, to provide an overview of DNA methylation profiling techniques. The advances in microarray and sequencing technologies make genome-wide profiling possible at a single-nucleotide or even a single-cell resolution. These profiling approaches vary in many aspects, such as DNA input, resolution, genomic region coverage, and bioinformatics analysis, and selecting a feasible method requires knowledge of these methods. We first introduce the biological background of DNA methylation and its pattern in plants, animals and fungi. We present an overview of major experimental approaches to profiling genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and then extend to the single-cell methylome. To evaluate these methods, we outline their strengths and weaknesses and perform comparisons across the different platforms. Due to the increasing need to compute high-throughput epigenomic data, we interrogate the computational pipeline for bisulfite sequencing data and also discuss the concept of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This review summarizes the experimental and computational concepts for profiling genome-wide DNA methylation, followed by biological examples. Overall, this review provides researchers useful guidance for the selection of a profiling method suited to specific research questions.},

	abstract = {Dementia is one of the most debilitating aspects of Parkinson's disease. There are no validated biomarkers that can track Parkinson's disease progression, nor accurately identify patients who will develop dementia and when. Understanding the sequence of observable changes in Parkinson's disease in people at elevated risk for developing dementia could provide an integrated biomarker for identifying and managing individuals who will develop Parkinson's dementia. We aimed to estimate the sequence of clinical and neurodegeneration events, and variability in this sequence, using data-driven statistical modelling in two separate Parkinson's cohorts, focusing on patients at elevated risk for dementia due to their age at symptom onset. We updated a novel version of an event-based model that has only recently been extended to cope naturally with clinical data, enabling its application in Parkinson's disease for the first time. The observational cohorts included healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease, of whom those diagnosed at age 65 or older were classified as having high risk of dementia. The model estimates that Parkinson's progression in patients at elevated risk for dementia starts with classic prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (olfaction, sleep), followed by early deficits in visual cognition and increased brain iron content, followed later by a less certain ordering of neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra and cortex, neuropsychological cognitive deficits, retinal thinning in dopamine layers, and further deficits in visual cognition. Importantly, we also characterize variation in the sequence. We found consistent, cross-validated results within cohorts, and agreement between cohorts on the subset of features available in both cohorts. Our sequencing results add powerful support to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that visual processing specifically is affected early in patients with Parkinson's disease at elevated risk of dementia. This opens a route to earlier and more precise detection, as well as a more detailed understanding of the pathological mechanisms underpinning Parkinson's dementia.},

We first show that PCA can be formulated as a regression-type optimization problem; sparse loadings are then obtained by imposing the lasso (elastic net) constraint on the regression coefficients. Efficient algorithms are proposed to fit our SPCA models for both regular multivariate data and gene expression arrays.

	abstract = {Copathologies play an important role in the expression of the AD clinical phenotype and may influence treatment efficacy. Early-onset AD (EOAD), defined as manifesting before age 65, is viewed as a relatively pure form of AD with a more homogeneous neuropathological substrate. We sought to compare the frequency of common neuropathological diagnoses in a consecutive autopsy series of 96 patients with EOAD (median age of onset = 55 years, 44 females) and 48 with late-onset AD (LOAD) (median age of onset = 73 years, 14 females). The UCSF Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank database was reviewed to identify patients with a primary pathological diagnosis of AD. Prevalence and stage of Lewy body disease (LBD), limbic age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and vascular brain injury (VBI) were compared between the two cohorts. We found at least one non-AD pathological diagnosis in 98\% of patients with EOAD (versus 100\% of LOAD), and the number of comorbid diagnoses per patient was lower in EOAD than in LOAD (median=2 versus 3, Mann-Whitney Z = 3.00, p = 0.002). LBD and CAA were common in both EOAD and LOAD (CAA: 86\% versus 79\%, Fisher exact p = 0.33; LBD: 49\% versus 42\%, p = 0.48, respectively), although amygdala-predominant LBD was more commonly found in EOAD than LOAD (22\% versus 6\%, p = 0.02). In contrast, LATE (35\% versus 8\%, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001), HS (15\% versus 3\%, p = 0.02), AGD (58\% versus 41\%, p = 0.052), and VBI (65\% versus 39\%, p = 0.004) were more common in LOAD than EOAD, respectively. The number of copathologies predicted worse cognitive performance at the time of death on MMSE (1.4 points/pathology (95\%CI [-2.5, -0.2]) and Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (1.15 point/pathology, 95\%CI [0.45, 1.84]), across the EOAD and the LOAD cohorts. The effect of sex on the number of copathologies was not significant (p = 0.17). Prevalence of at least one APOE ϵ4 allele was similar across the two cohorts (52\% and 54\%) and was associated with a greater number of copathologies (+0.40, 95\%CI [0.01, 0.79], p = 0.047), independent of age of symptom onset, sex, and disease duration. Females showed higher density of neurofibrillary tangles compared to men, controlling for age of onset, APOE ϵ4, and disease duration. Our findings suggest that non-AD pathological diagnoses play an important role in the clinical phenotype of EOAD with potentially significant implications for clinical practice and clinical trials design.},

Purpose: To compare regional brain volume difference between PD without dementia (PDND) and PD with dementia (PDD). Material and Methods: We enrolled 16 normal controls (mean±SD: 69.5±6.31) and 32 sex-, age-matched patients with PD (16 PDND and 16 PDD patients with Hoehn \& Yahr stage II or III). Cognitive function was assessed using mini-mental status examination (MMSE). Intracranial volume (ICV) and the hippocampal volumes were manually measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Regional gray/white matter volume changes were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. Results: Age, ICV, volume of gray matter volume (GMV), white matter, and hippocampi did not differ among the three groups. The regional GMV of PDD was significantly decreased in the areas of right middle frontal gyrus, short insular gyri, superior temporal gyri; both precuneus compared to PDND (uncorrected P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). In the partial correlation analysis (controlled for age, sex, ICV), regional GMV of PD was positively correlated with MMSE score in the areas of short insular gyri, right circular insular sulcus, right calcarine sulcus, left superior temporal gyrus (planum porale), and left inferior precentral sulcus (uncorrected P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Conclusion: We suggest that the volume loss of hippocampus may not be a finding in developing of PDD while variation of the regional volume of the frontal, insular cortex, superior temporal gyri, and precuneus lobes may be a phenomenon of PDD.},

The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum.

For ex- ample, there are two main approaches to the study of breast cancer: histopathology (analyzing visual characteristics of tumor biopsies) and genetics. While histopathology is the gold standard for diagnos- tics and there have been many recent breakthroughs in genetics, there is little overlap between these two fields. We aim to bridge this gap by developing methods based on Angle-based Joint and Individual Variation Explained to compare and contrast data from histopathol- ogy and genetics. Quantitative analysis of histopathology data re- quires statistical analysis of images and presents a variety of chal- lenges including feature extraction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven adept at solving predictive tasks with images and are believed to be powerful, automatic feature extraction algo- rithms. Leveraging deep learning for exploratory/inferential analysis, where the goal is for humans to learn about patterns in the data, is challenging because deciphering signals captured by deep learning algorithms is a notoriously difficult problem. We therefore develop methods for interpreting visual signals discovered in the data when doing exploratory analysis using CNNs for image feature extraction. Finally, we give new results about the subspace geometry underlying many multi-block data algorithms. 1.},

	abstract = {Label fusion strategies are used in multi-atlas image segmentation approaches to compute a consensus segmentation of an image, given a set of candidate segmentations produced by registering the image to a set of atlases [19, 11, 8]. Effective label fusion strategies, such as local similarity-weighted voting [1, 13] substantially reduce segmentation errors compared to single-atlas segmentation. This paper extends the label fusion idea to the problem of finding correspondences across a set of images. Instead of computing a consensus segmentation, weighted voting is used to estimate a consensus coordinate map between a target image and a reference space. Two variants of the problem are considered: (1) where correspondences between a set of atlases are known and are propagated to the target image; (2) where correspondences are estimated across a set of images without prior knowledge. Evaluation in synthetic data shows that correspondences recovered by fusion methods are more accurate than those based on registration to a population template. In a 2D example in real MRI data, fusion methods result in more consistent mappings between manual segmentations of the hippocampus. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Despite a significant growth in the last few years, the availability of 3D content is still dwarfed by that of its 2D counterpart. To close this gap, many 2D-to-3D image and video conversion methods have been proposed. Methods involving human operators have been most successful but also time-consuming and costly. Automatic methods, which typically make use of a deterministic 3D scene model, have not yet achieved the same level of quality for they rely on assumptions that are often violated in practice. In this paper, we propose a new class of methods that are based on the radically different approach of learning the 2D-to-3D conversion from examples. We develop two types of methods. The first is based on learning a point mapping from local image/video attributes, such as color, spatial position, and, in the case of video, motion at each pixel, to scene-depth at that pixel using a regression type idea. The second method is based on globally estimating the entire depth map of a query image directly from a repository of 3D images (image+depth pairs or stereopairs) using a nearest-neighbor regression type idea. We demonstrate both the efficacy and the computational efficiency of our methods on numerous 2D images and discuss their drawbacks and benefits. Although far from perfect, our results demonstrate that repositories of 3D content can be used for effective 2D-to-3D image conversion. An extension to video is immediate by enforcing temporal continuity of computed depth maps. © 1992-2012 IEEE.},

A synthetic average image is derived from the MRI of the samples using shape and intensity averaging in the diffeomorphic non-linear registration framework, and a consensus labeling of the template is generated. The agreement of the consensus labeling with manual labeling of each sample is measured, and the effect of aiding registration with landmarks and manually generated mask images is evaluated.

	abstract = {Human brain atlases are essential for research and surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). For example, deep brain stimulation for PD often requires human brain atlases for brain structure identification. However, few atlases can provide disease-specific subcortical structures for PD, and most of them are based on T1w and T2w images. In this work, we construct a HybraPD atlas using fused quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and T1w images from 87 patients with PD. The constructed HybraPD atlas provides a series of templates, that is, T1w, GRE magnitude, QSM, R2*, and brain tissue probabilistic maps. Then, we manually delineate a parcellation map with 12 bilateral subcortical nuclei, which are highly related to PD pathology, such as sub-regions in globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Furthermore, we build a whole-brain parcellation map by combining existing cortical parcellation and white-matter segmentation with the proposed subcortical nuclei map. Considering the multimodality of the HybraPD atlas, the segmentation accuracy of each nucleus is evaluated using T1w and QSM templates, respectively. The results show that the HybraPD atlas provides more accurate segmentation than existing atlases. Moreover, we analyze the metabolic difference in subcortical nuclei between PD patients and healthy control subjects by applying the HybraPD atlas to calculate uptake values of contrast agents on positron emission tomography (PET) images. The atlas-based analysis generates accurate disease-related brain nuclei segmentation on PET images. The newly developed HybraPD atlas could serve as an efficient template to study brain pathological alterations in subcortical regions for PD research.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source ANTsRNet—a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here. Materials and Methods: Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively. Results: Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 ± 0.03, right lung: 0.94 ± 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 ± 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 ± 0.02, right lung: 0.96 ± 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 ± 0.01), processing time is {\textbackslash}textless1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers. Conclusion: The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Current analytical techniques applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data require a priori knowledge or specific assumptions about the time courses of processes contributing to the measured signals. Here we describe a new method for analyzing fMRI data based on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129-1159). We decomposed eight fMRI data sets from 4 normal subjects performing Stroop color-naming, the Brown and Peterson work/number task, and control tasks into spatially independent components. Each component consisted of voxel values at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component "map"), and a unique associated time course of activation. Given data from 144 time points collected during a 6-min trial, ICA extracted an equal number of spatially independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived one and only one component with a time course closely matching the time course of 40-sec alternations between experimental and control tasks. The regions of maximum activity in these consistently task-related components generally overlapped active regions detected by standard correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not detected by correlation. Time courses of other ICA components were transiently task-related, quasiperiodic, or slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order statistics to enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm and a related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon [1994]: Signal Processing 36:11-20) were superior to principal component analysis (PCA) in determining the spatial and temporal extent of task-related activation. For each subject, the time courses and active regions of the task-related ICA components were consistent across trials and were robust to the addition of simulated noise. Simulated movement artifact and simulated task-related activations added to actual fMRI data were clearly separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to distinguish between nontask-related signal components, movements, and other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently task-related fMRI activations, based on only weak assumptions about their spatial distributions and without a priori assumptions about their time courses. ICA appears to be a highly promising method for the analysis of fMRI data from normal and clinical populations, especially for uncovering unpredictable transient patterns of brain activity associated with performance of psychomotor tasks.},

	abstract = {Peer-reviewed publications are the primary mechanism for sharing scientific results. The current peer-review process is, however, fraught with many problems that undermine the pace, validity, and credibility of science. We highlight five salient problems: (1) reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise; (2) reviewers do not have sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study; (3) reviewers are neither identified nor acknowledged; (4) there is no measure of the quality of a review; and (5) reviews take a lot of time, and once submitted cannot evolve. We propose that these problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process. Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer's specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer. Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive evaluation would facilitate transparency, greater scrutiny, and replication of results. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively assess reviewer contributions, which could be used to establish the impact of the reviewer in the scientific community. Quantifying review quality could help establish the importance of individual reviews and reviewers as well as the submitted article. Finally, we recommend expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialogue to continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner. We argue that these solutions can be implemented by adapting existing features from open-source software management and social networking technologies.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces. Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces. Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic analysis was performed on three volunteers. RESULTS: Tag lines in inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous 3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior. CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged (3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (∼0.5mm×0.5mm), thick slices (∼2.0mm), and a field of view tailored to imaging the hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper) has been advanced as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal morphometry. Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived from HF-MRI has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (∼1mm 3) T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort of healthy controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While measurements obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those obtained from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect of greater atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated minimum sample size required for detecting a 25\% change in patients' atrophy rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with a statistical power β=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample size was N=325. Using a dataset of test-retest scans, we show that the measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate that these results were not a confound of certain methodological choices made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making longitudinal measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest (ROI) around the HF to globally align serial images, followed by slice-by-slice deformable registration to measure local volume change. Additionally, we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements within hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences in atrophy rates were detected in several subfields. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Since the completion of the human genome project in 2003, extraordinary progress has been made in genome sequencing technologies, which has led to a decreased cost per megabase and an increase in the number and diversity of sequenced genomes. An astonishing complexity of genome architecture has been revealed, bringing these sequencing technologies to even greater advancements. Some approaches maximize the number of bases sequenced in the least amount of time, generating a wealth of data that can be used to understand increasingly complex phenotypes. Alternatively, other approaches now aim to sequence longer contiguous pieces of DNA, which are essential for resolving structurally complex regions. These and other strategies are providing researchers and clinicians a variety of tools to probe genomes in greater depth, leading to an enhanced understanding of how genome sequence variants underlie phenotype and disease.},

	abstract = {Segmenting and quantifying gliomas from MRI is an important task for diagnosis, planning intervention, and for tracking tumor changes over time. However, this task is complicated by the lack of prior knowledge concerning tumor location, spatial extent, shape, possible displacement of normal tissue, and intensity signature. To accommodate such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed ANTsR package–a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing entry in the MICCAI 2013 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge. The challenge data were widely varying consisting of both high-grade and low-grade glioma tumor four-modality MRI from five different institutions. Average Dice overlap measures for the final algorithmic assessment were 0.87, 0.78, and 0.74 for "complete", "core", and "enhanced" tumor components, respectively.},

This spreading pattern was thought to be fairly consistent across individuals, although recent work has demonstrated substantial variability in the population with AD. Using tau-positron emission tomography scans from 1,612 individuals, we identified 4 distinct spatiotemporal trajectories of tau pathology, ranging in prevalence from 18 to 33\%. We replicated previously described limbic-predominant and medial temporal lobe-sparing patterns, while also discovering posterior and lateral temporal patterns resembling atypical clinical variants of AD. These ‘subtypes' were stable during longitudinal follow-up and were replicated in a separate sample using a different radiotracer. The subtypes presented with distinct demographic and cognitive profiles and differing longitudinal outcomes. Additionally, network diffusion models implied that pathology originates and spreads through distinct corticolimbic networks in the different subtypes. Together, our results suggest that variation in tau pathology is common and systematic, perhaps warranting a re-examination of the notion of ‘typical AD' and a revisiting of tau pathological staging.},

There has been little to no work examining the reproducibility of network metrics derived from different types of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (e.g.; resting vs. task related, or pulse sequences other than standard blood oxygen level dependent [BOLD] data) or of measures of network structure at levels other than summary statistics. Here, we take up these questions, comparing the reproducibility of graphs derived from resting arterial spin-labeling perfusion fMRI with those derived from BOLD scans collected while the participant was performing a task. We also examine the reproducibility of the anatomical connectivity implied by the graph by investigating test-retest consistency of the graphs' edges. We compare two measures of graph-edge consistency both within versus between subjects and across data types. We find a dissociation in the reproducibility of network metrics, with metrics from resting data most reproducible at lower frequencies and metrics from task-related data most reproducible at higher frequencies; that same dissociation is not recapitulated, however, in network structure, for which the task-related data are most consistent at all frequencies.

The framework requires standard spatial reference systems (principally Waxholm Space, WHS) and a supporting data sharing infrastructure (Digital Atlasing Infrastructure, DAI); each of which is the main focus of an Atlasing Task Force. User data are primarily shared through atlas hubs, specialized servers available as part of the infrastructure or that may be installed and managed locally. Hubs register users' data to a spatial reference system, publish the data and services with INCF Central and share data via web services. At this time, the focus of both groups is on integrating image registration workflows to the underlying infrastructure with the aid of metadata, provenance, and ontology standards. Data sharing use cases drive our workflow development. At this time, we are focusing on 2D brain slice images (sampling varies from sparse to densely sampled). The goal is to create tools, recommendations, and standard operating procedures to aid in the registration of data to a known standard atlas space and creation of new atlas hubs. With workflows that allow the creation of atlas hubs, new datasets will be able to be queried and compared to data in other atlas hubs, such as EMAGE and Allen Brain Atlas. The two task forces are working on multiple related project areas, including: •Production of registration fiducials and landmarks •Standards for registration transformations •Data management and handling •Metadata •Provenance •Atlas hub in a Box •WHS for the rat •PONS pan mammalian delineations of WHS dataset These areas are either needed to integrate other components with the INCF DAI, or are integrated with the infrastructure as they are developed.

RGCCA is a component-based approach which aims to study the relationships between several sets of variables. The quality and interpretability of the RGCCA components are likely to be affected by the usefulness and relevance of the variables in each block. Therefore, it is an important issue to identify within each block which subsets of significant variables are active in the relationships between blocks. In this paper, RGCCA is extended to address the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) is proposed to combine RGCCA with an \vphantom{\{}\}{\textbackslash}backslashell 1\vphantom{\{}\}-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes SGCCA a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and usefulness of SGCCA are illustrated on a simulated dataset and on a 3-block dataset which combine gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization, and a qualitative phenotype measured on a set of 53 children with glioma.

The reduction of the CT radiation dose, however, compromises the signal-to-noise ratio, which affects image quality and diagnostic performance. Recently, deep-learning-based algorithms have achieved promising results in LDCT denoising, especially convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures. This paper introduces a conveying path-based convolutional encoder-decoder (CPCE) network in 2-D and 3-D configurations within the GAN framework for LDCT denoising. A novel feature of this approach is that an initial 3-D CPCE denoising model can be directly obtained by extending a trained 2-D CNN, which is then fine-tuned to incorporate 3-D spatial information from adjacent slices. Based on the transfer learning from 2-D to 3-D, the 3-D network converges faster and achieves a better denoising performance when compared with a training from scratch. By comparing the CPCE network with recently published work based on the simulated Mayo data set and the real MGH data set, we demonstrate that the 3-D CPCE denoising model has a better performance in that it suppresses image noise and preserves subtle structures.},

White matter labels were provided by the JHU tractography atlas. Cortical thickness maps were generated using ANTs pipeline including N4 bias correction, registration-based brain extraction, 3- tissue segmentation using Atropos, and estimation of cortical thickness using DiReCT. NIREP data were used to estimate cortical labels. Consensus label estimation was generated using STAPLE. ROI-based regression analysis was employed using ANTsR-a data analysis interface between the statistical project R and ANTs. Student ttests were performed between groups using multiple testing FDR correction. Similar analyses were carried out for cortical thickness maps. Results Three groups were assessed. These included: (i) personnel attending a breacher training course (BTS, N= 19) based in Quantico, VA, (ii) instructors of that course with 1-3 years of experience (BI, N= 4), and (iii) instructors with 7-15 years of experience (EBI, N= 4). Neither the BTS nor the BI groups contained individuals with histories suggestive of prior TBI. In the EBI group, 3 of 4 subjects endorsed a history of mild TBI. Comparisons included: (i) BTS vs. BI, (ii) BTS vs. EBI, and (iii) BI vs. EBI. No significant differences were seen with cortical thickness or DTI assessments in the BTS vs. BI or the BI vs. EBI comparisons. Multiple statistically significant differences were seen in the BTS vs. EBI comparison. Some of these included: significant differences in mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) in the bilateral superior cerebellar peduncles and right posterior limb of the internal capsule. Changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), MD, and RD were also seen in the left cingulum. Alterations in MD and RD were noted in right superior corona radiata and corticospinal tract. Additionally, changes in cortical thickness were seen in the BTS vs. EBI comparison in the right precentral gyrus, left temporal pole, and left middle frontal region. Conclusions Personnel trained to perform breaching maneuvers may be exposed to hundreds of blast events during their career. The current study explores neuroimaging correlates in three groups of breachers with varying levels of experience. Statistically significant differences were seen in breachers with 7-15 years of experience when compared with personnel attending a breacher training course. No such differences were seen when comparing these groups to instructors with 1-3 years experience. These findings may represent a cumulative effect of repetitive blast exposure. Findings may also reflect changes associated with known mild TBI in three of four individuals in the experienced group. Ongoing studies will continue to assess whether cumulative changes are seen in the brains of individuals with occupational repetitive low level blast exposure.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (ERC) and the perirhinal cortex (PRC) are subregions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that play important roles in episodic memory representations, as well as serving as a conduit between other neocortical areas and the hippocampus. They are also the sites where neuronal damage first occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability to automatically quantify the volume and thickness of the ERC and PRC is desirable because these localized measures can potentially serve as better imaging biomarkers for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, large anatomical variation in the PRC makes it a challenging area for analysis. In order to address this problem, we propose an automatic segmentation, clustering, and thickness measurement approach that explicitly accounts for anatomical variation. The approach is targeted to highly anisotropic (0.4×0.4×2.0mm3) T2-weighted MRI scans that are preferred by many authors for detailed imaging of the MTL, but which pose challenges for segmentation and shape analysis. After automatically labeling MTL substructures using multi-atlas segmentation, our method clusters subjects into groups based on the shape of the PRC, constructs unbiased population templates for each group, and uses the smooth surface representations obtained during template construction to extract regional thickness measurements in the space of each subject. The proposed thickness measures are evaluated in the context of discrimination between patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and normal controls (NC). © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with ILD and 11 with COPD had undergone both PFT and HRCT within 3 days. For each patient, 93 image-based metrics were computed, and their relationships with the 21 clinically used PFT parameters were analyzed using a minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance statistical framework. The first 20 features were selected among the total of 114 mixed image metrics and PFT values in the characterization of ILD and COPD. RESULTS: Among the best-performing 20 features, 14 were image metrics, derived from attenuation histograms and texture descriptions. The highest relevance value computed from PFT parameters was 0.47, and the highest from image metrics was 0.52, given the theoretical bound as [0, 0.69]. The ILD or COPD classifier using the first four features achieved a 1.92\% error rate. CONCLUSIONS: Some image metrics are not only as good discriminators as PFT for the characterization of ILD and COPD but are also not redundant when PFT values are provided. Image metrics of attenuation histogram statistics and texture descriptions may be valuable for further investigation in computer-assisted diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To adapt the so-called nonlocal means filter to deal with magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially varying noise levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise). Materials and Methods: Most filtering techniques assume an equal noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This is the case of MR images with spatially varying noise levels, such as those obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of denoising strength of the filter. Such information is automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise estimation method. Results: The proposed method was validated and compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases. Conclusion: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to outperform the standard filter when spatially varying noise is present in the images. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Registration of diverse sources of brain atlas data to standard coordinate spaces, managing coordinate transformations between reference spaces, and assessing the degree of certainty of spatial location descriptions and coordinate transformations, are the key issues in enabling atlas data integration based on spatial location in the brain. The problem is complex, because: a) different atlases and image stacks present different reference models of rodent brain; b) different image modalities result in different delineations of features and functional areas; c) there are a number of coordinate systems developed for the brain, each with different spatial properties and associated error models; d) coordinate transformations computed between 2D and 3D brain atlases have different error models, with degrees of distortion depending on the transformation technique; and e) the "true" deformation is usually unknown. This issue becomes more challenging as we move to atlas data integration across species, where transformations based on brain coordinates are likely to be meaningless. To address this problem, the INCF Program on digital brain atlasing has developed a common reference space for mouse brain (Waxholm Space, or WHS), and a collection of atlas services, which support on-demand coordinate system description, coordinate transformations, and a range of requests based on point-of-interest queries. The atlas services have been deployed at several atlas hubs, initially supporting coordinate translation between WHS, reference plates and volume representations of the Allen Mouse Brain atlas, and the Paxinos-Watson atlas of the mouse brain. In addition, a mechanism has been developed to register additional image collections to the system of atlas hubs within INCF Digital Atlasing Infrastructure (INCF-DAI) and derive additional spatial reference system descriptions and transformations. This poster focuses on two extensions of the INCF-DAI work: (a) standardization of online spatial registration workflows and (b) addition of coordinate transformation and registration accuracy measures to atlas services. We demonstrate registration workflow steps, show derivation of certainty fields for transformations between known coordinate systems, and present methodology for reporting transformation accuracy derived over the course of spatial registration.

Our objective-specific neuroimaging genetics extended the sparse canonical correlation analysis by an additional data type related to the target task to investigate possible associations of the imaging–genetic, genetic–target, and imaging–target pairs simultaneously. The identified imaging, genetic, and combined features were used to construct analytical models to predict the AAO in a nested five-fold cross-validation. We compared our approach with those from two feature selection approaches where only associations of imaging–target and genetic–target were explored. Using only imaging features, AAO prediction was accurate in all methods. Using only genetic features, the results from other methods were worse or unstable compared to our model. Using both imaging and genetic features, our proposed model predicted the AAO well (r = 0.5486).

	abstract = {Rational The human perirhinal cortex (PRC) plays critical roles in episodic and semantic memory and visual perception. The PRC consists of Brodmann areas 35 and 36 (BA35, BA36). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), BA35 is the first cortical site affected by neurofibrillary tangle pathology, which is closely linked to neural injury in AD. Large anatomical variability, manifested in the form of different cortical folding and branching patterns, makes it difficult to segment the PRC in MRI scans. Pathology studies have found that in ∼97\% of specimens, the PRC falls into one of three discrete anatomical variants. However, current methods for PRC segmentation and morphometry in MRI are based on single-template approaches, which may not be able to accurately model these discrete variants Methods A multi-template analysis pipeline that explicitly accounts for anatomical variability is used to automatically label the PRC and measure its thickness in T2-weighted MRI scans. The pipeline uses multi-atlas segmentation to automatically label medial temporal lobe cortices including entorhinal cortex, PRC and the parahippocampal cortex. Pairwise registration between label maps and clustering based on residual dissimilarity after registration are used to construct separate templates for the anatomical variants of the PRC. An optimal path of deformations linking these templates is used to establish correspondences between all the subjects. Experimental evaluation focuses on the ability of single-template and multi-template analyses to detect differences in the thickness of medial temporal lobe cortices between patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n=41) and age-matched controls (n=44). Results The proposed technique is able to generate templates that recover the three dominant discrete variants of PRC and establish more meaningful correspondences between subjects than a single-template approach. The largest reduction in thickness associated with aMCI, in absolute terms, was found in left BA35 using both regional and summary thickness measures. Further, statistical maps of regional thickness difference between aMCI and controls revealed different patterns for the three anatomical variants.},

	abstract = {A situation where J blocks of variables X 1, {\textbackslash}ldots, X J are observed on the same set of individuals is considered in this paper. A factor analysis approach is applied to blocks instead of variables. The latent variables (LV's) of each block should well explain their own block and at the same time the latent variables of same order should be as highly correlated as possible (positively or in absolute value). Two path models can be used in order to obtain the first order latent variables. The first one is related to confirmatory factor analysis: each LV related to one block is connected to all the LV's related to the other blocks. Then, PLS path modeling is used with mode A and centroid scheme. Use of mode B with centroid and factorial schemes is also discussed. The second model is related to hierarchical factor analysis. A causal model is built by relating the LV's of each block X j to the LV of the super-block X J + 1 obtained by concatenation of X 1, {\textbackslash}ldots, X J . Using PLS estimation of this model with mode A and path-weighting scheme gives an adequate solution for finding the first order latent variables. The use of mode B with centroid and factorial schemes is also discussed. The higher order latent variables are found by using the same algorithms on the deflated blocks. The first approach is compared with the MAXDIFF/MAXBET Van de Geer's algorithm (1984) and the second one with the ACOM algorithm (Chessel and Hanafi, 1996).

We use RIPMMARC to improve the interpretation of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion images by removing the component of perfusion that is predicted by the underlying anatomy. Using patch-based, rotation invariant descriptors derived from the anatomical image, we learn a predictive relationship between local neuroanatomical structure and the corresponding perfusion image. This relation allows us to produce an image of perfusion that would be predicted given only the underlying anatomy and a residual image that represents perfusion information that cannot be predicted by anatomical features. Our learned structural features are significantly better at predicting brain perfusion than tissue probability maps, which are the input to standard partial volume correction techniques. Studies in test-retest data show that both the anatomically predicted and residual perfusion signals are highly replicable for a given subject. In a pediatric population, both the raw perfusion and structurally predicted images are tightly linked to age throughout adolescence throughout the brain. Interestingly, the residual perfusion also shows a strong correlation with age in selected regions including the hippocampi (corr=0.38, p-value {\textbackslash}textless10-6), precuneus (corr=-0.44, p{\textbackslash}textless10-5), and combined default mode network regions (corr=-0.45, p{\textbackslash}textless10-8) that is independent of global anatomy-perfusion trends.

	abstract = {Most patients with Alzheimer's disease present with amnestic problems; however, a substantial proportion, over-represented in young-onset cases, have atypical phenotypes including predominant visual, language, executive, behavioural, or motor dysfunction. In the past, these individuals often received a late diagnosis; however, availability of CSF and PET biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathologies and incorporation of atypical forms of Alzheimer's disease into new diagnostic criteria increasingly allows them to be more confidently diagnosed early in their illness. This early diagnosis in turn allows patients to be offered tailored information, appropriate care and support, and individualised treatment plans. These advances will provide improved access to clinical trials, which often exclude atypical phenotypes. Research into atypical Alzheimer's disease has revealed previously unrecognised neuropathological heterogeneity across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum. Neuroimaging, genetic, biomarker, and basic science studies are providing key insights into the factors that might drive selective vulnerability of differing brain networks, with potential mechanistic implications for understanding typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease.},

The posterior hippocampi of taxi drivers were significantly larger relative to those of control subjects. A more anterior hippocampal region was larger in control subjects than in taxi drivers. Hippocampal volume correlated with the amount of time spent as a taxi driver (positively in the posterior and negatively in the anterior hippocampus). These data are in accordance with the idea that the posterior hippocampus stores a spatial representation of the environment and can expand regionally to accommodate elaboration of this representation in people with a high dependence on navigational skills. It seems that there is a capacity for local plastic change in the structure of the healthy adult human brain in response to environmental demands.},

	abstract = {This review summarizes the last decade of work by the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) Consortium, a global alliance of over 1400 scientists across 43 countries, studying the human brain in health and disease. Building on large-scale genetic studies that discovered the first robustly replicated genetic loci associated with brain metrics, ENIGMA has diversified into over 50 working groups (WGs), pooling worldwide data and expertise to answer fundamental questions in neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology, and genetics. Most ENIGMA WGs focus on specific psychiatric and neurological conditions, other WGs study normal variation due to sex and gender differences, or development and aging; still other WGs develop methodological pipelines and tools to facilitate harmonized analyses of “big data” (i.e., genetic and epigenetic data, multimodal MRI, and electroencephalography data). These international efforts have yielded the largest neuroimaging studies to date in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. More recent ENIGMA WGs have formed to study anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts and behavior, sleep and insomnia, eating disorders, irritability, brain injury, antisocial personality and conduct disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. Here, we summarize the first decade of ENIGMA's activities and ongoing projects, and describe the successes and challenges encountered along the way. We highlight the advantages of collaborative large-scale coordinated data analyses for testing reproducibility and robustness of findings, offering the opportunity to identify brain systems involved in clinical syndromes across diverse samples and associated genetic, environmental, demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors.},

It was found that the top image features perform much better compared with the current clinical gold-standard spirometric values when considered individually.

	issn = {10538119},
	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.006},
	abstract = {We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative to manual segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis that a large fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject, and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method. The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl et al., 2002); hippocampus segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion (Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction using BET (Smith, 2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al., 2001). The wrapper method generates 72\%, 14\%, 29\% and 21\% fewer erroneously segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion as the host method, the average Dice overlap between reference segmentations and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction, white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Psychometric tests predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because the definition of clinical AD relies on those same psychometric tests, the ability of these tests to identify underlying AD pathology remains unclear. Objective: To determine the degree to which psychometric testing predicts molecular evidence of AD amyloid pathology, as indicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ)1-42, in patients with MCI, as compared to neuroimaging biomarkers. Methods: We identified 408 MCI subjects with CSF Aβ levels, psychometric test data, FDG-PET scans, and acceptable volumetric MR scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used psychometric tests and imaging biomarkers in univariate and multivariate models to predict Aβ status. Results: The 30-min delayed recall score of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was the best predictor of Aβ status among the psychometric tests, achieving an AUC of 0.67±0.02 and odds ratio of 2.5±0.4. FDG-PET was the best imaging-based biomarker (AUC 0.67±0.03, OR 3.2±1.2), followed by hippocampal volume (AUC 0.64±0.02, OR 2.4±0.3). A multivariate analysis based on the psychometric tests improved on the univariate predictors, achieving anAUCof 0.68±0.03 (OR 3.38±1.2). Adding imaging biomarkers to the multivariate analysis did not improve the AUC. Conclusion: Psychometric tests perform as well as imaging biomarkers to predict presence of molecular markers ofADpathology in MCI patients and should be considered in the determination of the likelihood that MCI is due to AD.},

	abstract = {We consider recovery of low-rank matrices from noisy data by hard thresholding of singular values, in which empirical singular values below a threshold λ are set to 0. We study the asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE) in a framework, where the matrix size is large compared with the rank of the matrix to be recovered, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the low-rank piece stays constant. The AMSE-optimal choice of hard threshold, in the case of n-by- n matrix in white noise of level σ, is simply (4/√3) √nσ ≈ 2.309 √nσ when σ is known, or simply 2.858 · ymed when σ is unknown, where ymed is the median empirical singular value. For nonsquare, m by n matrices with m ≠ n the thresholding coefficients 4/√3 and 2.858 are replaced with different provided constants that depend on m/n. Asymptotically, this thresholding rule adapts to unknown rank and unknown noise level in an optimal manner: it is always better than hard thresholding at any other value, and is always better than ideal truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), which truncates at the true rank of the low-rank matrix we are trying to recover. Hard thresholding at the recommended value to recover an n-by-n matrix of rank r guarantees an AMSE at most 3 nrσ2. In comparison, the guarantees provided by TSVD, optimally tuned singular value soft thresholding and the best guarantee achievable by any shrinkage of the data singular values are 5 nrσ2, 6 nrσ2, and 2 nrσ2, respectively. The recommended value for hard threshold also offers, among hard thresholds, the best possible AMSE guarantees for recovering matrices with bounded nuclear norm. Empirical evidence suggests that performance improvement over TSVD and other popular shrinkage rules can be substantial, for different noise distributions, even in relatively small n. © 2014 IEEE.},

It also incorporates outlier rejection by converting the energy into a stochastic matrix with entries for rejection probability. Previous applications of the method focused on finding transformations between unordered point sets. Thus, no topological constraints were required. In our application, we must consider the topology of the matching between the reference and the target curve. Our energy function also depends upon the rotation and scaling between the curves. Thus, we develop a topologically correct algorithm to update the are length correspondence, which is then used to update the similarity transformation. We further enhance robustness by using a scale-space description of the curves. This results in a curve-matching tool that, given an approximate initialization, is invariant to similarity transformations. We demonstrate the reliability of the technique by applying it to open and closed curves extracted from real patient images (cortical sulci in three dimensions and corpora callosa in two dimensions). The set of transformations is then used to compute anatomical atlases.},

	abstract = {We describe a recently recognized disease entity, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). LATE neuropathological change (LATE-NC) is defined by a stereotypical TDP-43 proteinopathy in older adults, with or without coexisting hippocampal sclerosis pathology. LATE-NC is a common TDP-43 proteinopathy, associated with an amnestic dementia syndrome that mimicked Alzheimer's-type dementia in retrospective autopsy studies. LATE is distinguished from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology based on its epidemiology (LATE generally affects older subjects), and relatively restricted neuroanatomical distribution of TDP-43 proteinopathy. In community-based autopsy cohorts, ∼25\% of brains had sufficient burden of LATE-NC to be associated with discernible cognitive impairment. Many subjects with LATE-NC have comorbid brain pathologies, often including amyloid-β plaques and tauopathy. Given that the 'oldest-old' are at greatest risk for LATE-NC, and subjects of advanced age constitute a rapidly growing demographic group in many countries, LATE has an expanding but under-recognized impact on public health. For these reasons, a working group was convened to develop diagnostic criteria for LATE, aiming both to stimulate research and to promote awareness of this pathway to dementia. We report consensus-based recommendations including guidelines for diagnosis and staging of LATE-NC. For routine autopsy workup of LATE-NC, an anatomically-based preliminary staging scheme is proposed with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on tissue from three brain areas, reflecting a hierarchical pattern of brain involvement: amygdala, hippocampus, and middle frontal gyrus. LATE-NC appears to affect the medial temporal lobe structures preferentially, but other areas also are impacted. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that subjects with LATE-NC also had atrophy in the medial temporal lobes, frontal cortex, and other brain regions. Genetic studies have thus far indicated five genes with risk alleles for LATE-NC: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, KCNMB2, and APOE. The discovery of these genetic risk variants indicate that LATE shares pathogenetic mechanisms with both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, but also suggests disease-specific underlying mechanisms. Large gaps remain in our understanding of LATE. For advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, there is an urgent need for research focused on LATE, including in vitro and animal models. An obstacle to clinical progress is lack of diagnostic tools, such as biofluid or neuroimaging biomarkers, for ante-mortem detection of LATE. Development of a disease biomarker would augment observational studies seeking to further define the risk factors, natural history, and clinical features of LATE, as well as eventual subject recruitment for targeted therapies in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common illness accompanied by considerable morbidity, mortality, costs, and heightened risk of suicide. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.},

	abstract = {Recently two anomalous results in the literature have shown that certain feature learning architectures can yield useful features for object recognition tasks even with untrained, random weights. In this paper we pose the question: why do random weights sometimes do so well? Our answer is that certain convolutional pooling architectures can be inherently frequency selective and translation invariant, even with random weights. Based on this we demonstrate the viability of extremely fast architecture search by using random weights to evaluate candidate architectures, thereby sidestepping the time-consuming learning process. We then show that a surprising fraction of the performance of certain state-of-the-art methods can be attributed to the architecture alone. Copyright 2011 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

	issn = {00086223},
	abstract = {Survival analysis examines and models the time it takes for events to occur. The prototypical such event is death, from which the name survival analysis and much of its terminology derives, but the ambit of application of survival analysis is much broader. Essentially the same methods are employed in a variety of disciplines under various rubrics for example, event-history analysis in sociology. In this appendix, therefore, terms such as survival are to be understood generically. Survival analysis focuses on the distribution of survival times. Although there are well known methods for estimating unconditional survival distributions, most interesting survival modeling examines the relationship between survival and one or more predictors, usually termed covariates in the survival-analysis literature. The subject of this appendix is the Cox proportional-hazards regression model (introduced in a seminal paper by Cox, 1972), a broadly applicable and the most widely used method of survival analysis. Although I will not discuss them here, the survival library in R and S-PLUS also contains all of the other commonly employed tools of survival analysis.1 As is the case for the other appendices to An R and S-PLUS Companion to Applied Regression, I assume that you have read the main text and are therefore familiar with S. In addition, I assume familiarity with Cox regression. I nevertheless begin with a review of basic concepts, primarily to establish terminology and notation. The second section of the appendix takes up the Cox proportional-hazards model with timeindependent covariates. Time-dependent covariates are introduced in the third section. A fourth and final section deals with diagnostics. There are many texts on survival analysis: Cox and Oakes (1984) is a classic (if now slightly dated) source. Allison (1995) presents a highly readable introduction to the subject based on the SAS statistical package, but nevertheless of general interest. The major example in this appendix is adapted from Allison. A book by Therneau and Grambsch (2000) is also worthy of mention here because Therneau is the author of the survival library for S. Extensive documentation for the survival library may be found in Therneau (1999).},

Speech fluency was assessed in 35 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) who presented with progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA, n = 11), semantic dementia (SemD, n = 12), or a social and executive disorder without aphasia (SOC/EXEC, n = 12). Fluency was quantified as the number of words per minute in an extended, semi-structured speech sample. This was related to language characteristics of the speech sample and to neuropsychological measures. PNFA patients were significantly less fluent than controls and other FTLD patients. Fluency correlated with grammatical expression but not with speech errors or executive difficulty. SemD and SOC/EXEC patients were also less fluent than controls. In SemD, fluency was associated with semantically limited content. In SOC/EXEC, fluency was associated with executive limitations. Voxel-based morphometry analyses of high-resolution MRI related fluency to gray matter volume in left inferior frontal, insula, and superior temporal regions for the entire cohort of FTLD patients. This region overlapped partially distinct atrophic areas in each FTLD subgroup. It thus appears to play a crucial role in speech fluency, which can be interrupted in different ways in different FTLD subgroups. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We describe our construction of probabilistic atlases that store detailed information on how the brain varies across age and gender, across time, in health and disease, and in large human populations. Specifically, we introduce a mathematical framework based on covariant partial differential equations (PDEs), pull-backs of mappings under harmonic flows, and high-dimensional random tensor fields to encode variations in cortical patterning, asymmetry and tissue distribution in a population-based brain image database (N =94 scans). We use this information to detect disease-specific abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, including dynamic changes over time. Illustrative examples are chosen to show how group patterns of cortical organization, asymmetry, and disease-specific trends can be resolved that are not apparent in individual brain images. Finally, we create four-dimensional (4D) maps that store probabilistic information on the dynamics of brain change in development and disease. Digital atlases that generate these maps show considerable promise in identifying general patterns of structural and functional variation in diseased populations, and revealing how these features depend on demographic, genetic, clinical and therapeutic parameters.},

Está bem estabelecido que o registro linear de um cérebro para outro é inadequado para alinhar estruturas cerebrais, de modo que vários algoritmos surgiram para registrar cérebros de forma não linear entre si. Este estudo é a maior avaliação de algoritmos de deformação não linear aplicados ao registro de imagens cerebrais já realizada. Quatorze algoritmos de laboratórios em todo o mundo são avaliados usando 8 medidas de erro diferentes. Mais de 45.000 registros entre 80 cérebros marcados manualmente foram realizados por algoritmos, incluindo: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, fluido JRD, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, e quatro algoritmos SPM5 diferentes ("SPM2-type" e Normalização regular, Segmentação Unificada, e a caixa de ferramentas DAR℡). Todos esses registros foram precedidos por registro linear entre os mesmos pares de imagens usando o FLIRT. Uma das descobertas mais significativas deste estudo é que o desempenho relativo dos métodos de registro em comparação parece ser pouco afetado pela escolha da população de participantes, protocolo de rotulagem e tipo de medida de sobreposição. Isso é importante porque sugere que os resultados são generalizáveis ​​para novas populações de sujeitos que são rotulados ou avaliados usando diferentes protocolos de rotulagem. Além disso, classificamos os 14 métodos de acordo com três análises completamente independentes (testes de permutação, testes ANOVA de uma via e classificação da zona de indiferença) e derivamos três classificações superiores quase idênticas dos métodos.

	doi = {10.1142/9789811215636_0037},
	abstract = {The accurate prediction of a cancer patient's risk of progression or death can guide clinicians in the selection of treatment and help patients in planning personal affairs. Predictive models based on patient-level data represent a tool for determining risk. Ideally, predictive models will use multiple sources of data (e.g., clinical, demographic, molecular, etc.). However, there are many challenges associated with data integration, such as overfitting and redundant features. In this paper we aim to address those challenges through the development of a novel feature selection and feature reduction framework that can handle correlated data. Our method begins by computing a survival distance score for gene expression, which in combination with a score for clinical independence, results in the selection of highly predictive genes that are non-redundant with clinical features. The survival distance score is a measure of variation of gene expression over time, weighted by the variance of the gene expression over all patients. Selected genes, in combination with clinical data, are used to build a predictive model for survival. We benchmark our approach against commonly used methods, namely lasso-as well as ridge-penalized Cox proportional hazards models, using three publicly available cancer data sets: kidney cancer (521 samples), lung cancer (454 samples) and bladder cancer (335 samples). Across all data sets, our approach built on the training set outperformed the clinical data alone in the test set in terms of predictive power with a c.Index of 0.773 vs 0.755 for kidney cancer, 0.695 vs 0.664 for lung cancer and 0.648 vs 0.636 for bladder cancer. Further, we were able to show increased predictive performance of our method compared to lasso-penalized models fit to both gene expression and clinical data, which had a c.Index of 0.767, 0.677, and 0.645, as well as increased or comparable predictive power compared to ridge models, which had a c.Index of 0.773, 0.668 and 0.650 for the kidney, lung, and bladder cancer data sets, respectively. Therefore, our score for clinical independence improves prognostic performance as compared to modeling approaches that do not consider combining non-redundant data. Future work will concentrate on optimizing the survival distance score in order to achieve improved results for all types of cancer.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover the dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, PCA's interpretability remains limited. Indeed, the components produced by PCA are often noisy or exhibit no visually meaningful patterns. Furthermore, the fact that the components are usually non-sparse may also impede interpretation, unless arbitrary thresholding is applied. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as sparse PCA (SPCA), have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem in neuroimaging, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images that capture most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining, e.g., and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes information on the underlying structure of the data. This paper presents the structured SPCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate SPCA-TV's effectiveness and versatility on three different data sets. It can be applied to any kind of structured data, such as, e.g., -dimensional array images or meshes of cortical surfaces. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches (such as SPCA and ElasticNet PCA) or structured approach (such as GraphNet PCA) are significant, since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easier to interpret and more stable across different samples.},

	abstract = {Detecting outliers in a large set of data objects is a major data mining task aiming at finding different mechanisms responsible for different groups of objects in a data set. All existing approaches, however, are based on an assessment of distances (sometimes indirectly by assuming certain distributions) in the full-dimensional Euclidean data space. In high-dimensional data, these approaches are bound to deteriorate due to the notorious "curse of dimensionality". In this paper, we propose a novel approach named ABOD (Angle-Based Outlier Detection) and some variants assessing the variance in the angles between the difference vectors of a point to the other points. This way, the effects of the "curse of dimensionality" are alleviated compared to purely distance-based approaches. A main advantage of our new approach is that our method does not rely on any parameter selection influencing the quality of the achieved ranking. In a thorough experimental evaluation, we compare ABOD to the well-established distance-based method LOF for various artificial and a real world data set and show ABOD to perform especially well on high-dimensional data.

	abstract = {As our brains age, we tend to experience cognitive decline and are at greater risk of neurodegenerative disease and dementia. Symptoms of chronic neuropsychiatric diseases are also exacerbated during ageing. However, the ageing process does not affect people uniformly; nor, in fact, does the ageing process appear to be uniform even within an individual. Here, we outline recent neuroimaging research into brain ageing and the use of other bodily ageing biomarkers, including telomere length, the epigenetic clock, and grip strength. Some of these techniques, using statistical approaches, have the ability to predict chronological age in healthy people. Moreover, they are now being applied to neurological and psychiatric disease groups to provide insights into how these diseases interact with the ageing process and to deliver individualised predictions about future brain and body health. We discuss the importance of integrating different types of biological measurements, from both the brain and the rest of the body, to build more comprehensive models of the biological ageing process. Finally, we propose seven steps for the field of brain-ageing research to take in coming years. This will help us reach the long-term goal of developing clinically applicable statistical models of biological processes to measure, track and predict brain and body health in ageing and disease.},

	abstract = {Background: Brain structure abnormalities throughout the course of Parkinson's Disease (PD) have yet to be fully elucidated. Inconsistent findings across studies may be partly due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous analysis methods. Using a multicenter approach and harmonized analysis methods, we aimed to overcome these limitations and shed light on disease stage-specific profiles of PD pathology as suggested by in vivo neuroimaging. Method: Individual brain MRI and clinical data from 2,367 PD patients and 1,183 healthy controls were collected from 19 sites, deriving from 20 countries. We analyzed regional cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and subcortical volume using mixed-effect linear models. Patients were grouped according to the Hoehn \& Yahr (HY) disease stages and compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Within the PD sample, we investigated associations between Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and brain morphology. Findings: The main analysis showed a thinner cortex in 38 of 68 regions in PD patients compared to controls ( dmax = -0·25, dmin = -0·13). The bilateral putamen (left: d = -0·16, right: d = -0·16) and left amygdala ( d = -0·15) were smaller in patients, while the left thalamus was larger ( d = 0·17). HY staging indicated that a thinner cortex initially presents in the occipital, parietal and temporal cortex, and extends towards caudally located brain regions with increased disease severity. From HY stage 2 and onwards the bilateral putamen and amygdala were consistently smaller with larger effects denoting each increment. Finally, we found that poorer cognitive cognitive performance was associated with widespread cortical thinning as well as lower volumes of core limbic structures. Interpretation: Our findings offer robust and novel imaging signatures that are specific to the disease severity stages and in line with an ongoing neurodegenerative process, highlighting the importance of such multicenter collaborations.

	abstract = {For the last years, a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the research about the link prediction (LP) problem in complex networks. This problem tries to predict the likelihood of an association between two not interconnected nodes in a network to appear in the future. One of the most important approaches to the LP problem is based on supervised machine learning (ML) techniques for classification. Although many works have presented promising results with this approach, choosing the set of features (variables) to train the classifiers is still a major challenge. In this article, we report on the effects of three different automatic variable selection strategies (Forward, Backward and Evolutionary) applied to the feature-based supervised learning approach in LP applications. The results of the experiments show that the use of these strategies does lead to better classification models than classifiers built with the complete set of variables. Such experiments were performed over three datasets (Microsoft Academic Network, Amazon and Flickr) that contained more than twenty different features each, including topological and domain-specific ones. We also describe the specification and implementation of the process used to support the experiments. It combines the use of the feature selection strategies, six different classification algorithms (SVM, K-NN, naïve Bayes, CART, random forest and multilayer perceptron) and three evaluation metrics (Precision, F-Measure and Area Under the Curve). Moreover, this process includes a novel ML voting committee inspired approach that suggests sets of features to represent data in LP applications. It mines the log of the experiments in order to identify sets of features frequently selected to produce classification models with high performance. The experiments showed interesting correlations between frequently selected features and datasets.},

	abstract = {Research in several fields now requires the analysis of data sets in which multiple high-dimensional types of data are available for a common set of objects. In particular, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) includes data from several diverse genomic technologies on the same cancerous tumor samples. In this paper we introduce Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE), a general decomposition of variation for the integrated analysis of such data sets. The decomposition consists of three terms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across data types, low-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each data type, and residual noise. JIVE quantifies the amount of joint variation between data types, reduces the dimensionality of the data and provides new directions for the visual exploration of joint and individual structures. The proposed method represents an extension of Principal Component Analysis and has clear advantages over popular two-block methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares.

The result is a method for designing variational energies that adjust the optimization process over the solution domain such that features which are salient in the human decision-making process are used. The application here is locating correspondence of corpora callosa that agree with expert user data. General principles that guide our particular application are first stated. These principles involve the definition of a generic variational problem and an associated optimization algorithm, given here for the case of matching curves. A small set of specific similarity criterion for curves is then defined. The ability of each feature to find correspondences that relate to human decisions is individually tested. Following the results of this study, a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) automatic landmarking and correspondence method is developed. The probabilities associated with the MAP estimates are also used to define variational weights that vary over the solution's domain. These methods are both evaluated with respect to known correspondences and inter-user variability. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

	abstract = {Multiview data clustering attracts more attention than their single-view counterparts due to the fact that leveraging multiple independent and complementary information from multiview feature spaces outperforms the single one. Multiview spectral clustering aims at yielding the data partition agreement over their local manifold structures by seeking eigenvalue-eigenvector decompositions. Among all the methods, low-rank representation (LRR) is effective, by exploring the multiview consensus structures beyond the low rankness to boost the clustering performance. However, as we observed, such classical paradigm still suffers from the following stand-out limitations for multiview spectral clustering of overlooking the flexible local manifold structure, caused by aggressively enforcing the low-rank data correlation agreement among all views, and such a strategy, therefore, cannot achieve the satisfied between-views agreement; worse still, LRR is not intuitively flexible to capture the latent data clustering structures. In this paper, first, we present the structured LRR by factorizing into the latent low-dimensional data-cluster representations, which characterize the data clustering structure for each view. Upon such representation, second, the Laplacian regularizer is imposed to be capable of preserving the flexible local manifold structure for each view. Third, we present an iterative multiview agreement strategy by minimizing the divergence objective among all factorized latent data-cluster representations during each iteration of optimization process, where such latent representation from each view serves to regulate those from other views, and such an intuitive process iteratively coordinates all views to be agreeable. Fourth, we remark that such data-cluster representation can flexibly encode the data clustering structure from any view with an adaptive input cluster number. To this end, finally, a novel nonconvex objective function is proposed via the efficient alternating minimization strategy. The complexity analysis is also presented. The extensive experiments conducted against the real-world multiview data sets demonstrate the superiority over the state of the arts.},

	abstract = {The nature and frequency of speech production errors in neurodegenerative disease have not previously been precisely quantified. In the present study, 16 patients with a progressive form of non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) were asked to tell a story from a wordless children's picture book. Errors in production were classified as either phonemic, involving language-based deformations that nevertheless result in possible sequences of English speech segments; or phonetic, involving a motor planning deficit and resulting in non-English speech segments. The distribution of cortical atrophy as revealed by structural MRI scans was examined quantitatively in a subset of PNFA patients (N = 7). The few errors made by healthy seniors were only phonemic in type. PNFA patients made more than four times as many errors as controls. This included both phonemic and phonetic errors, with a preponderance of errors (82\%) classified as phonemic. The majority of phonemic errors were substitutions that shared most distinctive features with the target phoneme. The systematic nature of these substitutions is not consistent with a motor planning deficit. Cortical atrophy was found in prefrontal regions bilaterally and peri-Sylvian regions of the left hemisphere. We conclude that the speech errors produced by PNFA patients are mainly errors at the phonemic level of language processing and are not caused by a motor planning impairment. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Subtypes of AD, defined using an algorithm based on the relative number of tangle counts in these regions, have been proposed - hippocampal sparing (relative sparing of the hippocampus but high cortical load), limbic predominant (high hippocampal load but lower load in association cortices), and typical (balanced neurofibrillary tangles counts in the hippocampus and association cortices) AD - and shown to be associated with distinct antemortem clinical phenotypes. The ability to distinguish these AD subtypes from the more typical tau signature in vivo could have important implications for clinical research. Flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) images acquired from 45 amyloid-positive participants, defined clinically as mild cognitive impairment or AD, aged 50-92 years, 56\% female, and estimated to be Braak V-VI based on their PET pattern of tau pathology, were studied. By translating the neuropathologic algorithm to flortaucipir PET scans, patterns of tau pathology consistent with autopsy findings, and with a similar prevalence, were identified in vivo. 6/45 (13\%) participants were identified as hippocampal sparing and 6/45 (13\%) as limbic predominant AD subtypes. Hippocampal sparing participants were significantly younger than those assigned to the other two subtypes. Worse performance on delayed recall was associated with increased hippocampal tau signal, and worse performance on the trail making test B-A was associated with lower values of the hippocampus to cortex ratio. Prospective studies can further validate the flortaucipir SUVR cut-points and the phenotype of the corresponding AD subtypes.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	abstract = {We describe here the use of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), an algorithm based on decomposition by parts that can reduce the dimension of expression data from thousands of genes to a handful of metagenes. Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

	abstract = {A new approach is presented for elastic registration of medical images, and is applied to magnetic resonance images of the brain. Experimental results demonstrate very high accuracy in superposition of images from different subjects. There are two major novelties in the proposed algorithm. First, it uses an attribute vector, i.e., a set of geometric moment invariants (GMIs) that are defined on each voxel in an image and are calculated from the tissue maps, to reflect the underlying anatomy at different scales. The attribute vector, if rich enough, can distinguish between different parts of an image, which helps establish anatomical correspondences in the deformation procedure; it also helps reduce local minima, by reducing ambiguity in potential matches. This is a fundamental deviation of our method, referred to as the hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration (HAMMER), from other volumetric deformation methods, which are typically based on maximizing image similarity. Second, in order to avoid being trapped by local minima, i.e., suboptimal poor matches, HAMMER uses a successive approximation of the energy function being optimized by lower dimensional smooth energy functions, which are constructed to have significantly fewer local minima. This is achieved by hierarchically selecting the driving features that have distinct attribute vectors, thus, drastically reducing ambiguity in finding correspondence. A number of experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm results in accurate superposition of image data from individuals with significant anatomical differences.},

	abstract = {Not all neural network architectures are created equal, some perform much better than others for certain tasks. But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes are related to variable combinations of emphysema and small-airway disease, the latter manifested as air trapping (AT) on imaging. The investigators propose a method to extract AT information quantitatively from thoracic multi-detector row high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), validated by pulmonary function testing (PFT) correlation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent HRCT and PFT within a 3-day interval were retrospectively identified. Thin-section volumetric HRCT in inspiration and expiration was registered and analyzed using custom-made software. Nonaerated regions of lung were segmented through exclusion of voxels {\textbackslash}textgreater-50 Hounsfield units (HU); emphysematous areas were segmented as voxels {\textbackslash}textless-950 HU on inspiratory images. Small-airway AT volume (ATV) was segmented as regions of lung voxels whose attenuation values increased by less than a specified change threshold (set from 5 to 300 HU in 25-HU increments) between inspiration and expiration. Inspiratory and expiratory total segmented lung volumes, emphysema volume (EV), and ATV for each threshold were subsequently calculated and correlated with PFT parameters. RESULTS: A strong positive correlation was obtained between total segmented lung volume in inspiration and total lung capacity (r = 0.83). A strong negative correlation (r = -0.80) was obtained between EV and the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity. Stronger negative correlation with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -0.85) was demonstrated when ATV (threshold, 50 HU) was added to EV, indicating improved quantification of total AT to predict obstructive disease severity. A moderately strong positive correlation between ATV and residual volume was observed, with a maximum r value of 0.72 (threshold, 25 HU), greater than that between EV and residual volume (r = 0.58). The benefit of ATV quantification was greater in a subgroup of patients with negligible emphysema compared to patients with moderate to severe emphysema. CONCLUSIONS: Small-airway AT segmentation in conjunction with emphysema segmentation through computer-assisted methodologies may provide better correlations with key PFT parameters, suggesting that the quantification of emphysema-related and small airway-related components of AT from thoracic HRCT has great potential to elucidate phenotypic differences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative condition affecting the motor system, but recent work also shows more widespread cognitive impairment. This study examined performance on measures requiring knowledge of actions, and related performance to MRI cortical atrophy in ALS. METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ALS performed measures requiring word-description matching and associativity judgments with actions and objects. Voxel-based morphometry was used to relate these measures to cortical atrophy using high resolution structural MRI. RESULTS: Patients with ALS were significantly more impaired on measures requiring knowledge of actions than measures requiring knowledge of objects. Difficulty on measures requiring action knowledge correlated with cortical atrophy in motor cortex, implicating degraded knowledge of action features represented in motor cortex of patients with ALS. Performance on measures requiring object knowledge did not correlate with motor cortex atrophy. Several areas correlated with difficulty for both actions and objects, implicating these brain areas in components of semantic memory that are not dedicated to a specific category of knowledge. CONCLUSION: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are impaired on measures involving action knowledge, and this appears to be due to at least two sources of impairment: degradation of knowledge about action features represented in motor cortex and impairment on multicategory cognitive components contributing more generally to semantic memory.},

The method is then investigated in a multi-scale framework, which has the advantage of reducing the effects of noise and occlusion. A novel scale-space derived energy functional that incorporates geometric information from many scales at once is proposed. The related issue of selecting a smoothing kernel for a given matching problem is also explored, resulting in a topologically based method of scale-selection. This application requires estimating the matching between the fine and coarse scale versions of the same curve.

	abstract = {To understand multifactorial conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) we need brain signatures that predict the impact of multiple pathologies and their interactions. To help uncover the relationships between pathology affected brain circuits and cognitive markers we have used mouse models that represent, at least in part, the complex interactions altered in AD, while being raised in uniform environments and with known genotype alterations. In particular, we aimed to understand the relationship between vulnerable brain circuits and memory deficits measured in the Morris water maze, and we tested several predictive modeling approaches. We used in vivo manganese enhanced MRI traditional voxel based analyses to reveal regional differences in volume (morphometry), signal intensity (activity), and magnetic susceptibility (iron deposition, demyelination). These regions included hippocampus, olfactory areas, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum, as well as the frontal association area. The properties of these regions, extracted from each of the imaging markers, were used to predict spatial memory. We next used eigenanatomy, which reduces dimensionality to produce sets of regions that explain the variance in the data. For each imaging marker, eigenanatomy revealed networks underpinning a range of cognitive functions including memory, motor function, and associative learning, allowing the detection of associations between context, location, and responses. Finally, the integration of multivariate markers in a supervised sparse canonical correlation approach outperformed single predictor models and had significant correlates to spatial memory. Among a priori selected regions, expected to play a role in memory dysfunction, the fornix also provided good predictors, raising the possibility of investigating how disease propagation within brain networks leads to cognitive deterioration. Our cross-sectional results support that modeling approaches integrating multivariate imaging markers provide sensitive predictors of AD-like behaviors. Such strategies for mapping brain circuits responsible for behaviors may help in the future predict disease progression, or response to interventions.},

Explicitly minimizing the diffeomorphic metric distance improves the sharpness and accuracy of the derived template. We illustrate this accuracy by computing optimal templates from a simple dataset of ellipses. Our shape optimizing method yields results that reproduce the analytically known optimal template. A related method that uses diffeomorphisms to find an unbiased optimal intensity template does not yield the theoretical result.

We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images.

This approach is effective when using the large deformation viscous framework, where linear averaging is not valid, or in the elastic case. The theory behind this novel atlas building algorithm is similar to the traditional pairwise registration problem, but with single image forces replaced by average forces. These group forces drive an average transport ordinary differential equation allowing one to estimate the geodesic that moves an image toward the mean shape configuration. This model gives large deformation atlases that are optimal with respect to the shape manifold as defined by the data and the image registration assumptions. We use the techniques in the large deformation context here, but they also pertain to small deformation atlas construction. Furthermore, a natural, inherently inverse consistent image registration is gained for free, as is a tool for constant arc length geodesic shape interpolation. The geodesic atlas creation algorithm is quantitatively compared to the Euclidean anatomical average to elucidate the need for optimized atlases. The procedures generate improved average representations of highly variable anatomy from distinct populations. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

During each scan the number of points candidate to belong to the solution set is sensibly reduced. The second phase returns the exact solution by doing a single scan which examines further a little fraction of the data set.

Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Background: Commonly used neuroimaging biomarkers in Parkinson's disease (PD) are useful for diagnosis but poor at predicting outcomes. We explored whether an atrophy pattern from whole-brain structural MRI, measured in the drug-naïve early stage, could predict PD prognosis. Methods: 362 de novo PD patients with T1-weighted MRI (n = 222 for the main analysis, 140 for the validation analysis) were recruited from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We investigated a previously identified PD-specific network atrophy pattern as a potential biomarker of disease severity and prognosis. Progression trajectories of motor function (MDS-UPDRS-part III), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)), and a global composite outcome measure were compared between atrophy tertiles using mixed effect models. The prognostic value of the MRI atrophy measure was compared with 123I ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography, the postural-instability-gait-disturbance score, and cerebrospinal fluid markers. Findings: After 4.5 years follow-up, PD-specific atrophy network score at baseline significantly predicted change in UPDRS-part III (r = −0.197, p =.003), MoCA (r = 0.253, p =.0002) and global composite outcome (r = −0.249, p =.0002). Compared with the 3rd tertile (i.e. least atrophy), the tertile with the highest baseline atrophy (i.e. the 1st tertile) had a 3-point annual faster progression in UPDRS-part III (p =.012), faster worsening of posture-instability gait scores (+0.21 further annual increase, p {\textbackslash}textless.0001), faster decline in MoCA (−0.74 further annual decline in MoCA, p =.0372) and a + 0.38 (p =.0029) faster annual increase in the global composite z-score. All findings were replicated in a validation analysis using 1.5T MRI. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed the superiority of the MRI biomarker, although it had modest AUC values (0.63). By comparison, the other biomarkers were limited in their ability to predict prognosis either in the main or validation analysis. Interpretation: A PD-specific network atrophy pattern predicts progression of motor, cognitive, and global outcome in PD, and is a better predictor of prognosis than any of the other tested biomarkers. Therefore, it has potential as a prognostic biomarker for clinical trials of early PD.},

	abstract = {In task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers seek to measure fMRI signals related to a given task or condition. In many circumstances, measuring this signal of interest is limited by noise. In this study, we present GLMdenoise, a technique that improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by entering noise regressors into a general linear model (GLM) analysis of fMRI data. The noise regressors are derived by conducting an initial model fit to determine voxels unrelated to the experimental paradigm, performing principal components analysis (PCA) on the time-series of these voxels, and using cross-validation to select the optimal number of principal components to use as noise regressors. Due to the use of data resampling, GLMdenoise requires and is best suited for datasets involving multiple runs (where conditions repeat across runs). We show that GLMdenoise consistently improves cross-validation accuracy of GLM estimates on a variety of event-related experimental datasets and is accompanied by substantial gains in SNR. To promote practical application of methods, we provide MATLAB code implementing GLMdenoise. Furthermore, to help compare GLMdenoise to other denoising methods, we present the Denoise Benchmark (DNB), a public database and architecture for evaluating denoising methods. The DNB consists of the datasets described in this paper, a code framework that enables automatic evaluation of a denoising method, and implementations of several denoising methods, including GLMdenoise, the use of motion parameters as noise regressors, ICA-based denoising, and RETROICOR/RVHRCOR. Using the DNB, we find that GLMdenoise performs best out of all of the denoising methods we tested.},

	abstract = {Converging lines of evidence suggest an adverse effect of heavy cannabis use on adolescent brain development, particularly on the hippocampus. In this preliminary study, we compared hippocampal morphology in 14 "treatment-seeking" adolescents (aged 18-20) with a history of prior heavy cannabis use (5.8 joints/day) after an average of 6.7 months of drug abstinence, and 14 demographically matched normal controls. Participants underwent a high-resolution 3D MRI as well as cognitive testing including the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Heavy-cannabis users showed significantly smaller volumes of the right (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.04) and left (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.02) hippocampus, but no significant differences in the amygdala region compared to controls. In controls, larger hippocampus volumes were observed to be significantly correlated with higher CVLT verbal learning and memory scores, but these relationships were not observed in cannabis users. In cannabis users, a smaller right hippocampus volume was correlated with a higher amount of cannabis use (r = -0.57, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.03). These data support a hypothesis that heavy cannabis use may have an adverse effect on hippocampus development. These findings, after an average 6.7 month of supervised abstinence, lend support to a theory that cannabis use may impart long-term structural and functional damage. Alternatively, the observed hippocampal volumetric abnormalities may represent a risk factor for cannabis dependence. These data have potential significance for understanding the observed relationship between early cannabis exposure during adolescence and subsequent development of adult psychopathology reported in the literature for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We survey the field of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) source estimation. These modalities offer the potential for functional brain mapping with temporal resolution in the millisecond range. However, the limited number of spatial measurements and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem present significant limits to our ability to produce accurate spatial maps from these data without imposing major restrictions on the form of the inverse solution. Here we describe approaches to solving the forward problem of computing the mapping from putative inverse solutions into the data space. We then describe the inverse problem in terms of low dimensional solutions, based on the equivalent current dipole (ECD), and high dimensional solutions, in which images of neural activation are constrained to the cerebral cortex. We also address the issue of objective assessment of the relative performance of inverse procedures by the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve. We conclude with a discussion of methods for assessing statistical significance of experimental results through use of the bootstrap for determining confidence regions in dipole-fitting methods, and random field (RF) and permutation methods for detecting significant activation in cortically constrained imaging studies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We present a robust, high-throughput, semiautomated template-based protocol for segmenting the hippocampus in temporal lobe epilepsy. The semiautomated component of this approach, which minimizes user effort while maximizing the benefit of human input to the algorithm, relies on "incomplete labeling." Incomplete labeling requires the user to quickly and approximately segment a few key regions of the hippocampus through a user-interface. Subsequently, this partial labeling of the hippocampus is combined with image similarity terms to guide volumetric diffeomorphic normalization between an individual brain and an unbiased disease-specific template, with fully labeled hippocampi. We solve this many-to-few and few-to-many matching problem, and gain robustness to inter and intrarater variability and small errors in user labeling, by embedding the template-based normalization within a probabilistic framework that examines both label geometry and appearance data at each label. We evaluate the reliability of this framework with respect to manual labeling and show that it increases minimum performance levels relative to fully automated approaches and provides high inter-rater reliability. Thus, this approach does not require expert neuroanatomical training and is viable for high-throughput studies of both the normal and the highly atrophic hippocampus. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {A multivariate classification approach has been presented to examine the brain abnormalities, i.e., due to prenatal cocaine exposure, using both structural and functional brain images. First, a regional statistical feature extraction scheme was adopted to capture discriminative features from voxel-wise morphometric and functional representations of brain images, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the features used for classification, as well as to achieve the robustness to registration error and inter-subject variations. Then, this feature extraction method was used in conjunction with a hybrid feature selection method and a nonlinear support vector machine for the classification of brain abnormalities. This brain classification approach has been applied to detecting the brain abnormality associated with prenatal cocaine exposure in adolescents. A promising classification performance was achieved on a data set of 49 subjects (24 normal and 25 prenatally cocaine-exposed teenagers), with a leave-one-out cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our method, as well as the importance of incorporating both structural and functional images for brain classification. Moreover, spatial patterns of group difference derived from the constructed classifier were mostly consistent with the results of the conventional statistical analysis method. Therefore, the proposed approach provided not only a multivariate classification method for detecting brain abnormalities, but also an alternative way for group analysis of multimodality images. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We used this combination to perform high-localization precision, ultrahigh-labeling density, multicolor localization microscopy in samples up to 20 μm thick, including dividing cells and the neuromast organ of a zebrafish embryo.

These include variation in the hemodynamic response across voxels and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We evaluate several analysis techniques that address these problems for event-related fMRI. (1) Many fMRI analyses assume a canonical hemodynamic response function, but this assumption may lead to inaccurate data models. By adopting the finite impulse response model, we show that voxel-specific hemodynamic response functions can be estimated directly from the data. (2) There is a large amount of low-frequency noise fluctuation (LFF) in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) time-series data. To compensate for this problem, we use polynomials as regressors for LFF. We show that this technique substantially improves SNR and is more accurate than high-pass filtering of the data. (3) Model overfitting is a problem for the finite impulse response model because of the low SNR of the BOLD response. To reduce overfitting, we estimate a hemodynamic response timecourse for each voxel and incorporate the constraint of time-event separability, the constraint that hemodynamic responses across event types are identical up to a scale factor. We show that this technique substantially improves the accuracy of hemodynamic response estimates and can be computed efficiently. For the analysis techniques we present, we evaluate improvement in modeling accuracy via 10-fold cross-validation.},

	abstract = {The effects of early life experience on later brain structure and function have been studied extensively in animals, yet the relationship between childhood experience and normal brain development in humans remains largely unknown. Using a unique longitudinal data set including ecologically valid in-home measures of early experience during childhood (at age 4 and 8 years) and high-resolution structural brain imaging during adolescence (mean age 14 years), we examined the effects on later brain morphology of two dimensions of early experience: parental nurturance and environmental stimulation. Parental nurturance at age 4 predicts the volume of the left hippocampus in adolescence, with better nurturance associated with smaller hippocampal volume. In contrast, environmental stimulation did not correlate with hippocampal volume. Moreover, the association between hippocampal volume and parental nurturance disappears at age 8, supporting the existence of a sensitive developmental period for brain maturation. These findings indicate that variation in normal childhood experience is associated with differences in brain morphology, and hippocampal volume is specifically associated with early parental nurturance. Our results provide neuroimaging evidence supporting the important role of warm parental care during early childhood for brain maturation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2016.90},
	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {There is a growing need to analyze datasets characterized by several sets of variables observed on a single set of observations. Such complex but structured dataset are known as multiblock dataset, and their analysis requires the development of new and flexible tools. For this purpose, Kernel Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (KGCCA) is proposed and offers a general framework for multiblock data analysis taking into account an a priori graph of connections between blocks. It appears that KGCCA subsumes, with a single monotonically convergent algorithm, a remarkably large number of well-known and new methods as particular cases. KGCCA is applied to a simulated 3-block dataset and a real molecular biology dataset that combines Gene Expression data, Comparative Genomic Hybridization data and a qualitative phenotype measured for a set of 53 children with glioma. KGCCA is available on CRAN as part of the RGCCA package.},

	abstract = {We present an exploration of the interplay between the extent of organ motion and contrast-enhancement on image registration success. A model of a DCE MRI of the liver incorporating an isotropic elastic non-rigid deformation is used to simulate both breathing and breath-hold data, a volume-preserving modification for tumour regions is included. Contrast enhancement is simulated by applying a pharmacokinetic model. For each simulated dataset, a direct fluid registration of each image to the first in the dataset is compared to a contrast-enhancement guided method known as Progressive Principal Component Registration (PPCR). Analysis of the correction to the deformation fields, tumour volume change and dispersion of joint image histograms are used to show the importance of motion type on PPCR success and of enhancement level on direct fluid registration success. For breathing motion, PPCR registers groups of images to separate locations, but maintains enhancing tumour volume. This is not the case for direct registration with volume changes of up to 7\%. For inconsistent breath-hold depth, PPCR out-performs direct registration, particularly for large enhancement levels. Analysis of the joint histograms suggests that the generation of target images using PPCR reduces dispersion due to contrast enhancement. Since this distinction is not made using direct registration, it is unable to register images when large enhancement intensity changes are present.},

JIVE has been used to explore multi-source data for a variety of application areas but its accessibility was previously limited. We introduce R.JIVE, an intuitive R package to perform JIVE and visualize the results. We discuss several improvements and extensions of the JIVE methodology that are included.

Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures.

	abstract = {Importance: Despite a hypothesis that harboring a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2(LRRK2) G2019S variation and a glucocerebrosidase (GBA) variant would have a combined deleterious association with disease pathogenesis, milder clinical phenotypes have been reported in dual LRRK2 and GBA variations Parkinson disease (PD) than in GBA variation PD alone. Objective: To evaluate the association of LRRK2 G2019S and GBA variants with longitudinal cognitive and motor decline in PD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study of continuous measures in LRRK2 PD, GBA PD, LRRK2/GBA PD, and wild-type idiopathic PD used pooled annual visit data ranging from 2004 to 2019 from the Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Parkinson Disease Biomarker Program, Harvard Biomarkers Study, Ashkenazi Jewish-LRRK2-Consortium, Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative, and SPOT-PD studies. Patients who were screened for GBA and LRRK2 variations and completed either a motor or cognitive assessment were included. Data were analyzed from May to July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The associations of LRRK2 G2019S and GBA genotypes on the rate of decline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-Part III scores were examined using linear mixed effects models with PD duration as the time scale. Results: Among 1193 individuals with PD (mean [SD] age, 66.6 [9.9] years; 490 [41.2\%] women), 128 (10.7\%) had GBA PD, 155 (13.0\%) had LRRK2 PD, 21 (1.8\%) had LRRK2/GBA PD, and 889 (74.5\%) had idiopathic PD. Patients with GBA PD had faster decline in MoCA than those with LRRK2/GBA PD (B [SE], -0.31 [0.09] points/y; P {\textbackslash}textless.001), LRRK2 PD (B [SE], -0.33 [0.09] points/y; P {\textbackslash}textless.001), or idiopathic PD (B [SE], -0.23 [0.08] points/y; P =.005). There was a LRRK2 G2019S × GBA interaction in MoCA decline (B [SE], 0.22 [0.11] points/y; P =.04), but not after excluding severe GBA variations (B [SE], 0.12 [0.11] points/y; P =.28). Patients with GBA PD had significantly worse motor progression compared with those with idiopathic PD (B [SE], 0.49 [0.22] points/y; P =.03) or LRRK2 PD (B [SE], 0.77 [0.26] points/y; P =.004). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that longitudinal cognitive decline in patients with GBA PD was more severe than in those with LRRK2/GBA PD, which more closely resembled LRRK2 PD. This further supports the notion of a dominant association of LRRK2 on GBA in individuals who carry both and raises the possibility of an LRRK2 × GBA interaction. However, the biological basis of a dominant association or interaction is not clear and is apparently contrary to basic investigations. Study of a larger cohort of individuals with severe GBA variation is warranted..},

	abstract = {The hippocampus is a major structure of interest affected by temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis has traditionally been used to study hippocampal involvement in TLE, although spatial variation of structural and functional pathology have been known to exist within the ROI. In this article, structure-specific analysis (Yushkevich et al. (2007) Neuroimage 35:1516-1530) is applied to the study of both structure and function in TLE patients. This methodology takes into account information about the spatial correspondence of voxels within ROIs on left and right sides of the same subject as well as between subjects. Hippocampal thickness is studied as a measure of structural integrity, and functional activation in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which subjects performed a memory encoding task is studied as a measure of functional integrity. Pronounced disease-related decrease in thickness is found in posterior and anterior hippocampus. A region in the body also shows increased thickness in patients' healthy hippocampi compared with controls. Functional activation in diseased hippocampi is reduced in the body region compared to controls, whereas a region in the tail showing greater right-lateralized activation in controls also shows greater activation in healthy hippocampi compared with the diseased side in patients. Summary measurements generated by integrating quantities of interest over the entire hippocampus can also be used, as is done in conventional ROI analysis. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {In both theoretical and applied research, it is often of interest to assess the strength of an observed association. This is typically done to allow the judgment of the magnitude of an effect (especially when units of measurement are not meaningful, e.g., in the use of estimated latent variables; Bollen, 1989), to facilitate comparing between predictors' importance within a given model, or both. Though some indices of effect size, such as the correlation coefficient (itself a standardized covariance coefficient) are readily available, other measures are often harder to obtain. effectsize is an R package (R Core Team, 2020) that fills this important gap, providing utilities for easily estimating a wide variety of standardized effect sizes (i.e., effect sizes that are not tied to the units of measurement of the variables of interest) and their confidence intervals (CIs), from a variety of statistical models. effectsize provides easy-to-use functions, with full documentation and explanation of the various effect sizes offered, and is also used by developers of other R packages as the back-end for effect size computation, such as parameters (Lüdecke et al., 2020), ggstatsplot (Patil, 2018), gtsummary (Sjoberg et al., 2020) and more. Comparison to Other Packages effectsize's functionality is in part comparable to packages like lm.beta (Behrendt, 2014), MOTE (Buchanan et al., 2019), and MBESS (K. Kelley, 2020). Yet, there are some notable differences, e.g.: • lm.beta provides standardized regression coefficients for linear models, based on post-hoc model matrix standardization. However, the functionality is available only for a limited number of models (models inheriting from the lm class), whereas effectsize provides support for many types of models, including (generalized) linear mixed models, Bayesian models, and more. Additionally, in additional to post-hoc model matrix standardization, effectsize offers other methods of standardization (see below). • Both MOTE and MBESS provide functions for computing effect sizes such as Cohen's d and effect sizes for ANOVAs (Cohen, 1988), and their confidence intervals. However, both require manual input of For t-statistics, degrees of freedom, and sums of squares for the computation the effect sizes, whereas effectsize can automatically extract this information from the provided models, thus allowing for better ease-of-use as well as reducing any potential for error.

	abstract = {We present a unified method, based on symmetric diffeomorphisms, for studying longitudinal neurodegeneration. Our method first uses symmetric diffeomorphic normalization to find a spatiotemporal parameterization of an individual's image time series. The second step involves mapping a representative image or set of images from the time series into an optimal template space. The template mapping is then combined with the intrasubject spatiotemporal map to enable pairwise statistical tests to be performed on a population of normalized time series images. Here, we apply this longitudinal analysis protocol to study the gray matter atrophy patterns induced by frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We sample our normalized spatiotemporal maps at baseline (time zero) and time one year to generate an annualized atrophy map (AAM) that estimates the annual effect of FTD. This spatiotemporal normalization enables us to locate neuroanatomical regions that consistently undergo significant annual gray matter atrophy across the population. We found the majority of annual atrophy to occur in the frontal and temporal lobes in our population of 20 subjects. We also found significant effects in the hippocampus, insula and cingulate gyrus. Our novel results, significant at p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05 after false discovery rate correction, are represented in local template space but also assigned Talairach coordinates and Brodmann and Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) labels.

Structural MRI and demographic data from a sample of 283 healthy children from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development were used to investigate the relationship between SES and prefrontal cortical thickness. Specifically, we assessed the association between two principal measures of childhood SES, family income and parental education, and gray matter thickness in specific subregions of prefrontal cortex and on the asymmetry of these areas. After correcting for multiple comparisons and controlling for potentially confounding variables, parental education significantly predicted cortical thickness in the right anterior cingulate gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. These results suggest that brain structure in frontal regions may provide a meaningful link between SES and cognitive function among healthy, typically developing children. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

We extended this investigation to patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and PD dementia (PDD) by examining grammatical and working memory components of sentence processing in the full range of patients with Lewy body spectrum disorder (LBSD). Thirty-three patients with LBSD were given a two-alternative, forced-choice sentence-picture matching task. Sentence type, working memory, and grammatical structure were systematically manipulated in the sentences. We found that patients with PDD and DLB were significantly impaired relative to non-demented PD patients and healthy controls. The deficit in PDD/DLB was most pronounced for sentences lengthened by the strategic placement of an additional prepositional phrase and for sentences with an additional proposition due to a center-embedded clause. However, there was no effect for subject-relative versus object-relative grammatical structure. An MRI voxel-based morphometry analysis in a subset of patients showed significant gray matter thinning in the frontal lobe bilaterally, and this extended to temporal, parietal and occipital regions. A regression analysis related sentence processing difficulty in LBSD to frontal neocortex, including inferior prefrontal, premotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, as well as right superior temporal cortex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with PDD and DLB have difficulty processing sentences with increased working memory demands and that this deficit is related in part to their frontal disease. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12918-016-0312-1},
	abstract = {Background: Recently, structured sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) has received increased attention in brain imaging genetics studies. It can identify bi-multivariate imaging genetic associations as well as select relevant features with desired structure information. These SCCA methods either use the fused lasso regularizer to induce the smoothness between ordered features, or use the signed pairwise difference which is dependent on the estimated sign of sample correlation. Besides, several other structured SCCA models use the group lasso or graph fused lasso to encourage group structure, but they require the structure/group information provided in advance which sometimes is not available. Results: We propose a new structured SCCA model, which employs the graph OSCAR (GOSCAR) regularizer to encourage those highly correlated features to have similar or equal canonical weights. Our GOSCAR based SCCA has two advantages: 1) It does not require to pre-define the sign of the sample correlation, and thus could reduce the estimation bias. 2) It could pull those highly correlated features together no matter whether they are positively or negatively correlated. We evaluate our method using both synthetic data and real data. Using the 191 ROI measurements of amyloid imaging data, and 58 genetic markers within the APOE gene, our method identifies a strong association between APOE SNP rs429358 and the amyloid burden measure in the frontal region. In addition, the estimated canonical weights present a clear pattern which is preferable for further investigation. Conclusions: Our proposed method shows better or comparable performance on the synthetic data in terms of the estimated correlations and canonical loadings. It has successfully identified an important association between an Alzheimer's disease risk SNP rs429358 and the amyloid burden measure in the frontal region.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is an observational, international study designed to establish biomarker-defined cohorts and identify clinical, imaging, genetic, and biospecimen Parkinson's disease (PD) progression markers to accelerate disease-modifying therapeutic trials. Methods: A total of 423 untreated PD, 196 Healthy Control (HC) and 64 SWEDD (scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit) subjects were enrolled at 24 sites. To enroll PD subjects as early as possible following diagnosis, subjects were eligible with only asymmetric bradykinesia or tremor plus a dopamine transporter (DAT) binding deficit on SPECT imaging. Acquisition of data was standardized as detailed at www.ppmi-info.org. Results: Approximately 9\% of enrolled subjects had a single PD sign at baseline. DAT imaging excluded 16\% of potential PD subjects with SWEDD. The total MDS-UPDRS for PD was 32.4 compared to 4.6 for HC and 28.2 for SWEDD. On average, PD subjects demonstrated 45\% and 68\% reduction in mean striatal and contralateral putamen Specific Binding Ratios (SBR), respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was acquired from {\textbackslash}textgreater97\% of all subjects. CSF (PD/HC/SWEDD pg/mL) alpha-synuclein (1845/2204/2141) was reduced in PD vs HC or SWEDD (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.03). Similarly, t-tau (45/53) and p-tau (16/18) were reduced in PD versus HC (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01),. Interpretation: PPMI has detailed the biomarker signature for an early PD cohort defined by clinical features and imaging biomarkers. This strategy provides the framework to establish biomarker cohorts and to define longitudinal progression biomarkers to support future PD treatment trials.},

	abstract = {While many neuroscience questions aim to understand the human brain, much current knowledge has been gained using animal models, which replicate genetic, structural, and connectivity aspects of the human brain. While voxel-based analysis (VBA) of preclinical magnetic resonance images is widely-used, a thorough examination of the statistical robustness, stability, and error rates is hindered by high computational demands of processing large arrays, and the many parameters involved therein. Thus, workflows are often based on intuition or experience, while preclinical validation studies remain scarce. To increase throughput and reproducibility of quantitative small animal brain studies, we have developed a publicly shared, high throughput VBA pipeline in a high-performance computing environment, called SAMBA. The increased computational efficiency allowed large multidimensional arrays to be processed in 1–3 days—a task that previously took ∼1 month. To quantify the variability and reliability of preclinical VBA in rodent models, we propose a validation framework consisting of morphological phantoms, and four metrics. This addresses several sources that impact VBA results, including registration and template construction strategies. We have used this framework to inform the VBA workflow parameters in a VBA study for a mouse model of epilepsy. We also present initial efforts towards standardizing small animal neuroimaging data in a similar fashion with human neuroimaging. We conclude that verifying the accuracy of VBA merits attention, and should be the focus of a broader effort within the community. The proposed framework promotes consistent quality assurance of VBA in preclinical neuroimaging, thus facilitating the creation and communication of robust results.},

	abstract = {Alternating minimization represents a widely applicable and empirically successful approach for finding low-rank matrices that best fit the given data. For example, for the problem of low-rank matrix completion, this method is believed to be one of the most accurate and efficient, and formed a major component of the winning entry in the Netflix Challenge [17]. In the alternating minimization approach, the low-rank target matrix is written in a bi-linear form, i.e. X = UV † ; the algorithm then alternates between finding the best U and the best V . Typically, each alternating step in isolation is convex and tractable. However the overall problem becomes non-convex and is prone to local minima. In fact, there has been almost no theoretical understanding of when this approach yields a good result. In this paper we present one of the first theoretical analyses of the performance of alternating minimization for matrix completion, and the related problem of matrix sensing. For both these problems, celebrated recent results have shown that they become well-posed and tractable once certain (now standard) conditions are imposed on the problem. We show that alternating minimization also succeeds under similar conditions. Moreover, compared to existing results, our paper shows that alternating minimization guarantees faster (in particular, geometric) convergence to the true matrix, while allowing a significantly simpler analysis.

	issn = {00905364},
	doi = {10.1214/12-AOS1032},
	abstract = {Many statistical \vphantom{\{}\}M\vphantom{\{}\}-estimators are based on convex optimization problems formed by the combination of a data-dependent loss function with a norm-based regularizer. We analyze the convergence rates of projected gradient and composite gradient methods for solving such problems, working within a high-dimensional framework that allows the data dimension \vphantom{\{}\}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashpdim\{{\textbackslash}backslash\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\} to grow with (and possibly exceed) the sample size \}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashnumobs\{{\textbackslash}backslash\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}. This high-dimensional structure precludes the usual global assumptions—namely, strong convexity and smoothness conditions—that underlie much of classical optimization analysis. We define appropriately restricted versions of these conditions, and show that they are satisfied with high probability for various statistical models. Under these conditions, our theory guarantees that projected gradient descent has a globally geometric rate of convergence up to the \vphantom{\{}\}{\textbackslash}backslash\}emph\{statistical precision\vphantom{\{}\} of the model, meaning the typical distance between the true unknown parameter \}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashtheta\{{\textbackslash}backslash{\textasciicircum}\{\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}*\} and an optimal solution \}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashhat\{{\textbackslash}backslash\{\}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashtheta\{{\textbackslash}backslash\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}. This result is substantially sharper than previous convergence results, which yielded sublinear convergence, or linear convergence only up to the noise level. Our analysis applies to a wide range of \vphantom{\{}\}M\}-estimators and statistical models, including sparse linear regression using Lasso (\}{\textbackslash}backslashbackslashell\{{\textbackslash}backslash\_\vphantom{\{}\}1\}-regularized regression); group Lasso for block sparsity; log-linear models with regularization; low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization; and matrix decomposition. Overall, our analysis reveals interesting connections between statistical precision and computational efficiency in high-dimensional estimation.},

	issn = {10538119},
	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.007},
	abstract = {Measurement of brain change due to neurodegenerative disease and treatment is one of the fundamental tasks of neuroimaging. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) has been long recognized as an effective and sensitive tool for estimating the change in the volume of brain regions over time. This paper demonstrates that a straightforward application of DBM to estimate the change in the volume of the hippocampus can result in substantial bias, i.e., an overestimation of the rate of change in hippocampal volume. In ADNI data, this bias is manifested as a non-zero intercept of the regression line fitted to the 6 and 12 month rates of hippocampal atrophy. The bias is further confirmed by applying DBM to repeat scans of subjects acquired on the same day. This bias appears to be the result of asymmetry in the interpolation of baseline and followup images during longitudinal image registration. Correcting this asymmetry leads to bias-free atrophy estimation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in neuroimaging methods have allowed researchers to obtain various structural and functional parameters from an individual in a whole-brain, voxel- wise manner. To conduct group level analyses utilizing such data, a one-to-one correspondence between voxels2 across individuals must be identified. The most common approach to this problem is registering individual brains to a standard template. Many sophisticated spatial registration methods are available for this purpose. However, when individual variability of the brains in the study population is substantially increased by injury or disease, achieving a satisfactory alignment across individual brains using the currently available registration protocols becomes a challenging task. Resorting to manual region-of-interest (ROI) drawing or using affine-only transformation may not be viable options because precise spatial normalization is a prerequisite for various powerful voxel-based techniques such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM; Ashburner \& Friston, 2000), tensor-based (or deformation-based) morphometry (TBM or DBM; Ashburner et al., 1998; Gaser, Volz, Kiebel, Riehemann, \& Sauer, 1999; Thompson, Woods, Mega, \& Toga, 2000), voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM; Rorden \& Karnath, 2004), and coordinate-based voxel-wise meta-analyses (Fox, Laird, \& Lancaster, 2005).},

	abstract = {Brain imaging researchers regularly work with large, heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets. Historically, researchers have dealt with this complexity idiosyncratically, with every lab or individual implementing their own preprocessing and analysis procedures. The resulting lack of field-wide standards has severely limited reproducibility and data sharing and reuse. To address this problem, we and others recently introduced the Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS; (Gorgolewski et al., 2016)), a specification meant to standardize the process of representing brain imaging data. BIDS is deliberately designed with adoption in mind; it adheres to a user-focused philosophy that prioritizes common use cases and discourages complexity. By successfully encouraging a large and ever-growing subset of the community to adopt a common standard for naming and organizing files, BIDS has made it much easier for researchers to share, re-use, and process their data (Gorgolewski et al., 2017). The ability to efficiently develop high-quality spec-compliant applications itself depends to a large extent on the availability of good tooling. Because many operations recur widely across diverse contexts-for example, almost every tool designed to work with BIDS datasets involves regular file-filtering operations-there is a strong incentive to develop utility libraries that provide common functionality via a standardized, simple API. PyBIDS is a Python package that makes it easier to work with BIDS datasets. In principle, its scope includes virtually any functionality that is likely to be of general use when working with BIDS datasets (i.e., that is not specific to one narrow context). At present, its core and most widely used module supports simple and flexible querying and manipulation of BIDS datasets. PyBIDS makes it easy for researchers and developers working in Python to search for BIDS files by keywords and/or metadata; to consolidate and retrieve file-associated metadata spread out across multiple levels of a BIDS hierarchy; to construct BIDS-valid path names for new files; and to validate projects against the BIDS specification, among other applications.},

The variational problems specifying these metrics are reviewed along with their associated Euler-Lagrange equations. The Euler equations of motion derived by Arnold for the geodesics in the group of divergence-free volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of incompressible fluids are generalized for the larger group of diffeomorphisms used in CA with nonconstant Jacobians. Metrics that accommodate photometric variation are described extending the anatomical model to incorporate the construction of neoplasm. Metrics on landmarked shapes are reviewed as well as Joshi's diffeomorphism metrics, Bookstein's thin-plate spline approximate-metrics, and Kendall's affine invariant metrics.

	doi = {10.1136/jnnp-2012-304418},
	abstract = {Background: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is most commonly associated with TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) or tau pathology at autopsy, but there are no in vivo biomarkers reliably discriminating between sporadic cases. As disease-modifying treatments emerge, it is critical to accurately identify underlying pathology in living patients so that they can be entered into appropriate etiology-directed clinical trials. Patients with tau inclusions (FTLD-TAU) appear to have relatively greater white matter (WM) disease at autopsy than those patients with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). In this paper, we investigate the ability of white matter (WM) imaging to help discriminate between FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP during life using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: Patients with autopsy-confirmed disease or a genetic mutation consistent with FTLD-TDP or FTLD-TAU underwent multimodal T1 volumetric MRI and diffusion weighted imaging scans. We quantified cortical thickness in GM and fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM. We performed Eigenanatomy, a statistically robust dimensionality reduction algorithm, and used leave-oneout cross-validation to predict underlying pathology. Neuropathological assessment of GM and WM disease burden was performed in the autopsy-cases to confirm our findings of an ante-mortem GM and WM dissociation in the neuroimaging cohort. Results: ROC curve analyses evaluated classification accuracy in individual patients and revealed 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for WM analyses. FTLDTAU had significantly more WM degeneration and inclusion severity at autopsy relative to FTLD-TDP. Conclusions: These neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations provide converging evidence for greater WM burden associated with FTLDTAU, and emphasise the role of WM neuroimaging for in vivo discrimination between FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP.},

	abstract = {A component based method (CompCor) for the reduction of noise in both blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and perfusion-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is presented. In the proposed method, significant principal components are derived from noise regions-of-interest (ROI) in which the time series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity. These components are then included as nuisance parameters within general linear models for BOLD and perfusion-based fMRI time series data. Two approaches for the determination of the noise ROI are considered. The first method uses high-resolution anatomical data to define a region of interest composed primarily of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second method defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of the time series data. With the application of CompCor, the temporal standard deviation of resting-state perfusion and BOLD data in gray matter regions was significantly reduced as compared to either no correction or the application of a previously described retrospective image based correction scheme (RETROICOR). For both functional perfusion and BOLD data, the application of CompCor significantly increased the number of activated voxels as compared to no correction. In addition, for functional BOLD data, there were significantly more activated voxels detected with CompCor as compared to RETROICOR. In comparison to RETROICOR, CompCor has the advantage of not requiring external monitoring of physiological fluctuations.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.012},
	abstract = {Background: We present an image analysis framework geared towards development of focal MRI biomarkers based on hippocampal subfields. This includes: 1) An automatic segmentation method that can reliably label hippocampal subfields, with accuracy comparable to manual labeling protocols (Neuroimage, 53:1208), 2) An automated analysis pipeline for measuring longitudinal atrophy rates within subfields, and 3) A detailed computational atlas of the human hippocampus constructed from MRI and histopathological staining of autopsy samples (Neuroimage, 50:434). We present preliminary studies using this framework. Methods: Focal T2-weighted MRI (HFMRI) were obtained with high resolution slices (0.5x0.6x2.6 mm3 for cross-sectional and 0.4x0.4x2 mm3 for longitudinal cohort), oriented orthogonal to the main axis of the hippocampus (see figure). We labeled subfields using our automatic segmentation technique, that uses a multiatlas based label fusion approach, and computed their normalized volume and thickness. Anisotropic resolution makes normalization (Figure presented) of baseline and 1-3 year follow up HFMRI challenging for longitudinal atrophy estimation.We align a small ROI around the hippocampus, providing better accuracy than whole brain normalization, followed by our unbiased deformation based morphometry strategy (Neuroimage, 50:434). In the cross-sectional study, CA1 had greater thickness in controls compared to MCI patients. Left CA1, DG, and whole hippocampus had most significant volume differences. In the longitudinal study, CA1 and HEAD had significant tissue shrinkage only in the patient group, which were also significantly greater than controls. The computational atlas has been enhanced using additional specimens undergoing both histological staining MRI scans. This will improve subfield labeling accuracy, and help label additional ROIs, e.g. perirhinal and postrhinal cortices. Conclusions: All software and the atlas are being made publicly available as development continues. The automated segmentation methodology lays the foundation for a cost-effective processing pipeline for in vivo data in large clinical studies where manual segmentation is prohibitively expensive. This technology enables group studies, including longitudinal studies, that require ROI labels. Further, we have attempted to address the challenges of measuring longitudinal change from HFMRI. We anticipate that enhancement of the atlas through histology data and refinement of analysis methods will reveal greater subfield- specific effects in larger datasets.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used tool for data analysis and dimension reduction in applications throughout science and engineering. However, the principal components (PCs) can sometimes be difficult to interpret, because they are linear combinations of all the original variables. To facilitate interpretation, sparse PCA produces modified PCs with sparse loadings, i.e. loadings with very few non-zero elements. In this paper, we propose a new sparse PCA method, namely sparse PCA via regularized SVD (sPCA-rSVD). We use the connection of PCA with singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix and extract the PCs through solving a low rank matrix approximation problem. Regularization penalties are introduced to the corresponding minimization problem to promote sparsity in PC loadings. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed for computation. Two tuning parameter selection methods are discussed. Some theoretical results are established to justify the use of sPCA-rSVD when only the data covariance matrix is available. In addition, we give a modified definition of variance explained by the sparse PCs. The sPCA-rSVD provides a uniform treatment of both classical multivariate data and high-dimension-low-sample-size (HDLSS) data. Further understanding of sPCA-rSVD and some existing alternatives is gained through simulation studies and real data examples, which suggests that sPCA-rSVD provides competitive results. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We first use a population-specific average Tl and DT template to label the thalamus and Brodmann areas (BA) 9,10 and 11 in each subject. We also build an expected connection model within this template space that is transferred to subject space in order to provide a prior restriction on probabilistic tracking performed in subject space. We evaluate the effect of traumatic brain injury on this prefrontal-thalamus network by quantifying, in 10 subjects and 8 controls, the mean diffusion and fractional anisotropy along fiber tracts, along with the mean diffusion within the thalamus and cortical regions. We contrast results gained by a template-based tract definition with those gained by performing analysis in the subject space.

The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

A fourth subtype, minimal atrophy AD, has been identified in several neuroimaging studies. Typical AD displays tau-related pathology and atrophy both in hippocampus and association cortex and has a pooled frequency of 55\%. Limbic-predominant, hippocampal-sparing, and minimal atrophy AD had a pooled frequency of 21\%, 17\%, and 15\%, respectively. Between-subtype differences were found in age at onset, age at assessment, sex distribution, years of education, global cognitive status, disease duration, APOE ϵ4 genotype, and CSF biomarker levels.ConclusionWe identified 2 core dimensions of heterogeneity: typicality and severity. We propose that these 2 dimensions determine individuals' belonging to one of the AD subtypes based on the combination of protective factors, risk factors, and concomitant non-AD brain pathologies. This model is envisioned to aid with framing hypotheses, study design, interpretation of results, and understanding mechanisms in future subtype studies. Our model can be used along the A/T/N classification scheme for AD biomarkers. Unraveling the heterogeneity within AD is critical for implementing precision medicine approaches and for ultimately developing successful disease-modifying drugs for AD.},

	volume = {17},
	abstract = {To evaluate our system for elastically deforming a three-dimensional atlas to match anatomical brain images, six deformed versions of an atlas were generated. The deformed atlases were created by elastically mapping an anatomical brain atlas onto different MR brain image volumes. The mapping matches the edges of the ventricles and the surface of the brain; the resultant deformations are propagated through the atlas volume, deforming the remainder of the structures in the process. The atlas was then elastically matched to its deformed versions. The accuracy of the resultant matches was evaluated by determining the correspondence of 32 cortical and subcortical structures. The system on average matched the centroid of a structure to within 1 mm of its true position and fit a structure to within 11\% of its true volume. The overlap between the matched and true structures, defined by the ratio between the volume of their intersection and the volume of their union, averaged 66\%. When the gray-white interface was included for matching, the mean overlap improved to 78\%; each structure was matched to within 0.6 mm of its true position and fit to within 6\% of its true volume. Preliminary studies were also made to determine the effect of the compliance of the atlas on the resultant match.},

	abstract = {Motivation Brain imaging genetics, which studies the linkage between genetic variations and structural or functional measures of the human brain, has become increasingly important in recent years. Discovering the bi-multivariate relationship between genetic markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroimaging quantitative traits (QTs) is one major task in imaging genetics. Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) has been a popular technique in this area for its powerful capability in identifying bi-multivariate relationships coupled with feature selection. The existing SCCA methods impose either the â.," 1-norm or its variants to induce sparsity. The â.," 0-norm penalty is a perfect sparsity-inducing tool which, however, is an NP-hard problem. Results In this paper, we propose the truncated â.," 1-norm penalized SCCA to improve the performance and effectiveness of the â.," 1-norm based SCCA methods. Besides, we propose an efficient optimization algorithms to solve this novel SCCA problem. The proposed method is an adaptive shrinkage method via tuning I.,. It can avoid the time intensive parameter tuning if given a reasonable small I.,. Furthermore, we extend it to the truncated group-lasso (TGL), and propose TGL-SCCA model to improve the group-lasso-based SCCA methods. The experimental results, compared with four benchmark methods, show that our SCCA methods identify better or similar correlation coefficients, and better canonical loading profiles than the competing methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods in discovering interesting imaging genetic associations.},

Recent work investigating more specific correlates of SES has identified SES disparities in executive function performance and measures of prefrontal cortical function, but little is known about the structural correlates of childhood socioeconomic status. Structural MRI and demographic data from a sample of 283 healthy children in the first wave of the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development were used to systematically investigate the relationship between SES and frontal cortical thickness. Specifically, we assessed the association between two principal measures of childhood SES, family income and parental education, on grey matter thickness in specific subregions of prefrontal cortex and on the asymmetry of these areas. After correcting for multiple comparisons and controlling for potentially confounding variables, parental education significantly predicted cortical thickness in the right anterior cingulate gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. These results suggest that brain structure in frontal regions may provide a meaningful link between SES and cognitive function among healthy, typically developing children.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in MRI and increasing knowledge on the characterization and anatomical variability of medial temporal lobe (MTL) anatomy have paved the way for more specific subdivisions of the MTL in humans. In addition, recent studies suggest that early changes in many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases are better detected in smaller subregions of the MTL rather than with whole structure analyses. Here, we developed a new protocol using 7 Tesla (T) MRI incorporating novel anatomical findings for the manual segmentation of entorhinal cortex (ErC), perirhinal cortex (PrC; divided into area 35 and 36), parahippocampal cortex (PhC), and hippocampus; which includes the subfields subiculum (Sub), CA1, CA2, as well as CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) which are separated by the endfolial pathway covering most of the long axis of the hippocampus. We provide detailed instructions alongside slice-by-slice segmentations to ease learning for the untrained but also more experienced raters. Twenty-two subjects were scanned (19–32 yrs, mean age = 26 years, 12 females) with a turbo spin echo (TSE) T2-weighted MRI sequence with high-resolution oblique coronal slices oriented orthogonal to the long axis of the hippocampus (in-plane resolution 0.44 × 0.44 mm2) and 1.0 mm slice thickness. The scans were manually delineated by two experienced raters, to assess intra- and inter-rater reliability. The Dice Similarity Index (DSI) was above 0.78 for all regions and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) were between 0.76 to 0.99 both for intra- and inter-rater reliability. In conclusion, this study presents a fine-grained and comprehensive segmentation protocol for MTL structures at 7 T MRI that closely follows recent knowledge from anatomical studies. More specific subdivisions (e.g. area 35 and 36 in PrC, and the separation of DG and CA3) may pave the way for more precise delineations thereby enabling the detection of early volumetric changes in dementia and neuropsychiatric diseases.},

Background: FTLD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with behavioral disturbances. Group studies have related these behaviors to volume loss on MRI. Methods: Forty caregivers of patients with the clinical diagnosis of FTLD completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Twelve neuropsychiatric symptoms and the associated caregiver distress were assessed. Optimized voxel-based morphometry identified significant atrophy in subgroups of FTLD patients with isolated behavioral symptoms corresponding to the most distressing behaviors, and we correlated cortical atrophy directly with these distressing behavioral disorders in an unbiased group analysis. Results: The greatest stressors for caregivers were apathy and disinhibition (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.005 for both contrasts). Partially distinct areas of cortical atrophy were associated with these behaviors in both individual patients with these symptoms and group-wide analyses, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in apathetic patients, and the medial orbital frontal cortex in disinhibited patients. Conclusions: Caregiver stress in families of FTLD patients is due in large part to apathy and disinhibition. The anatomic distribution of cortical loss corresponding to these distressing social behaviors includes partially distinct areas within the frontal lobe. Copyright © 2009 S. Karger AG.},

	abstract = {Accurate and precise measurement is an important component of any proper study design. As elaborated by Lin (1989, Biometrics 45, 255-268), the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is more appropriate than other indices for measuring agreement when the variable of interest is continuous. However, this agreement index is defined in the context of comparing two fixed observers. In order to use multiple observers in a study involving large numbers of subjects, there is a need to assess agreement among these multiple observers. In this article, we present an overall CCC (OCCC) in terms of the interobserver variability for assessing agreement among multiple fixed observers. The OCCC turns out to be equivalent to the generalized CCC (King and Chinchilli, 2001, Statistics in Medicine 20, 2131-2147; Lin, 1989; Lin, 2000, Biometrics 56, 324-325) when the squared distance function is used. We evaluated the OCCC through generalized estimating equations (Barnhart and Williamson, 2001, Biometrics 57, 931-940) and U-statistics (King and Chinchilli, 2001) for inference. This article offers the following important points. First, it addresses the precision and accuracy indices as components of the OCCC. Second, it clarifies that the OCCC is the weighted average of all pairwise CCCs. Third, it is intuitively defined in terms of interobserver variability. Fourth, the inference approaches of GEE and the U-statistics are compared via simulations for small samples. Fifth, we illustrate the use of the OCCC by two medical examples with the GEE, U-statistics, and bootstrap approaches.},

	abstract = {We present research in which both left and right ventricular deformation is estimated from tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using volumetric deformable models constructed from nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The four model types considered and compared for the left ventricle include two Cartesian NURBS models–one with a cylindrical parameter assignment and one with a prolate spheroidal parameter assignment. The remaining two are non-Cartesian, i.e., prolate spheroidal and cylindrical each with their respective prolate spheroidal and cylindrical parameter assignment regimes. These choices were made based on the typical shape of the left ventricle. For each frame starting with end-diastole, a NURBS model is constructed by fitting two surfaces with the same parameterization to the corresponding set of epicardial and endocardial contours from which a volumetric model is created. Using normal displacements of the three sets of orthogonal tag planes as well as displacements of contour/tag line intersection points and tag plane intersection points, one can solve for the optimal homogeneous coordinates, in a weighted least squares sense, of the control points of the deformed NURBS model at end-diastole using quadratic programming. This allows for subsequent nonrigid registration of the biventricular model at end-diastole to all later time frames. After registration of the model to all later time points, the registered NURBS models are temporally lofted in order to create a comprehensive four-dimensional NURBS model. From the lofted model, we can extract three-dimensional myocardial deformation fields and corresponding Lagrangian and Eulerian strain maps which are local measures of nonrigid deformation. The results show that, in the case of simulated data, the quadratic Cartesian NURBS models with the cylindrical and prolate spheroidal parameter assignments outperform their counterparts in predicting normal strain. The decreased complexity associated with the Cartesian model with the cylindrical parameter assignment prompted its use for subsequent calculations. Lagrangian strains in three canine data, a normal human, and a patient with history of myocardial infarction are presented. Eulerian strains for the normal human data are also included.},

	abstract = {In most supervised domain adaptation learning (DAL) tasks, one has access only to a small number of labeled examples from target domain. Therefore the success of supervised DAL in this "small sample" regime needs the effective utilization of the large amounts of unlabeled data to extract information that is useful for generalization. Toward this end, we here use the geometric intuition of manifold assumption to extend the established frameworks in existing model-based DAL methods for function learning by incorporating additional information about the target geometric structure of the marginal distribution. We would like to ensure that the solution is smooth with respect to both the ambient space and the target marginal distribution. In doing this, we propose a novel L1-norm locally linear representation regularization multi-source adaptation learning framework which exploits the geometry of the probability distribution, which has two techniques. Firstly, an L1-norm locally linear representation method is presented for robust graph construction by replacing the L2-norm reconstruction measure in LLE with L1-norm one, which is termed as L1-LLR for short. Secondly, considering the robust graph regularization, we replace traditional graph Laplacian regularization with our new L1-LLR graph Laplacian regularization and therefore construct new graph-based semi-supervised learning framework with multi-source adaptation constraint, which is coined as L1-MSAL method. Moreover, to deal with the nonlinear learning problem, we also generalize the L1-MSAL method by mapping the input data points from the input space to a high-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a nonlinear mapping. Promising experimental results have been obtained on several real-world datasets such as face, visual video and object.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although it is important to evaluate the substantia nigra in patients with parkinsonian syndrome, it is difficult to depict its anatomy, even by MR imaging. Using anatomic studies of the direction of nerve fibers around the snbstantia nigra, we attempted to depict this entity with multishot diffusion-weighted MR imaging to evaluate its topographic changes in patients with Parkinson's disease and secondary parkinsonism. METHODS: We measured the substantia nigra on 72 diffusion- weighted axial MR images obtained in 36 healthy control subjects, on 47 images obtained in 25 patients with Parkinson's disease, and on 10 images obtained in five patients with secondary parkinsonism. We considered the width of the minor axis of the substantia nigra as its 'thickness,' which appeared as a crescent-shaped region in the midbrain. RESULTS: Diffusion- weighted imaging portrayed the substantia nigra distinctly better than did T2-weighted imaging, because the surrounding white matter appeared as an area of high signal intensity. The mean (± SD) thickness values of the substantia nigra were 5.1 ± 0.89 mm in control subjects, 4.8 ± 0.75 mm in patients with Parkinson's disease, and 3.4 ± 0.53 mm in patients with secondary parkinsonism. CONCLUSION: Multishot diffusion-weighted imaging is a better imaging technique than T2-weighted imaging for demonstrating a change in size of the substantia nigra in vivo. The substantia nigra is not reduced in size in patients with Parkinson's disease, but it is reduced in patients with secondary parkinsonism.},

Results revealed that healthy adults activated vmPFC during judgments of negatively valenced scenarios relative to positive scenarios and neutral scenarios. In a comparative behavioral study, the same social decision-making paradigm was administered to patients with a social disorder due to FTLD. Patients differed significantly from healthy controls, specifically showing less sensitivity to negatively valenced features. Comparative anatomical analysis revealed considerable overlap of vmPFC activation in healthy adults and vmPFC cortical atrophy in FTLD patients.

The proposed solution is fully graph-based, without any need for additional search structures (typically used at the coarse search stage of the most proximity graph techniques). Hierarchical NSW incrementally builds a multi-layer structure consisting of a hierarchical set of proximity graphs (layers) for nested subsets of the stored elements. The maximum layer in which an element is present is selected randomly with an exponentially decaying probability distribution. This allows producing graphs similar to the previously studied Navigable Small World (NSW) structures while additionally having the links separated by their characteristic distance scales. Starting the search from the upper layer together with utilizing the scale separation boosts the performance compared to NSW and allows a logarithmic complexity scaling. Additional employment of a heuristic for selecting proximity graph neighbors significantly increases performance at high recall and in case of highly clustered data. Performance evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed general metric space search index is able to strongly outperform previous opensource state-of-the-art vector-only approaches. Similarity of the algorithm to the skip list structure allows straightforward balanced distributed implementation.},

Here, we explore the impact of target and reference region-of-interest (ROI) selection on SUVR effect sizes using interventional data from the ongoing phase 1b PRIME study (NCT01677572) of aducanumab (BIIB037) in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Methods: The florbetapir PET SUVR was calculated at baseline (screening) and at weeks 26 and 54 for patients randomized to receive placebo and each of 4 aducanumab doses (1, 3, 6, and 10 mg/kg) using the whole cerebellum, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, pons, and subcortical white matter as reference regions. In addition to the prespecified composite cortex target ROI, individual cerebral cortical ROIs were assessed as targets. Results: Of the reference regions used, subcortical white matter, cerebellar white matter, and the pons, alone or in combination, generated the largest effect sizes. The use of the anterior cingulate cortex as a target ROI resulted in larger effect sizes than the use of the composite cortex. SUVR calculations were not affected by correction for brain volume changes over time. Conclusion: Dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid PET SUVR were consistently observed with aducanumab only in cortical regions prone to amyloid plaque deposition, regardless of the reference region used. These data support the hypothesis that florbetapir SUVR responses associated with aducanumab treatment are a result of specific dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid burden in patients with Alzheimer disease.},

Two situations were studied: (i) where both loci had no effect on fitness and (ii) where they showed heterozygote superiority, but no epistacy. If the populations are initially in linkage equilibrium, then the mean value of D remains zero with inbreeding, but the mean of D2 increases to a maximum value and decreases until fixation is reached at both loci. The tighter the linkage and the greater the selection, then the later is the maximum in the mean of D2 reached, and the larger its value. The correlation of gene frequencies, r, in the population of gametes within segregating lines was also studied. It was found that, for a range of selection intensities and initial gene frequencies, the mean value of r2 was determined almost entirely by N c and time, measured proportional to N. The implication of these results on observations of linkage disequilibrium in natural populations is discussed. © 1968 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {As clinical and cognitive neuroscience mature, the need for sophisticated neuroimaging analysis becomes more apparent. Multivariate analysis techniques have recently received increasing attention as they have many attractive features that cannot be easily realized by the more commonly used univariate, voxel-wise, techniques. Multivariate approaches evaluate correlation/covariance of activation across brain regions, rather than proceeding on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Thus, their results can be more easily interpreted as a signature of neural networks. Univariate approaches, on the other hand, cannot directly address functional connectivity in the brain. The covariance approach can also result in greater statistical power when compared with univariate techniques, which are forced to employ very stringent, and often overly conservative, corrections for voxel-wise multiple comparisons. Multivariate techniques also lend themselves much better to prospective application of results from the analysis of one dataset to entirely new datasets. Multivariate techniques are thus well placed to provide information about mean differences and correlations with behavior, similarly to univariate approaches, with potentially greater statistical power and better reproducibility checks. In contrast to these advantages is the high barrier of entry to the use of multivariate approaches, preventing more widespread application in the community. To the neuroscientist becoming familiar with multivariate analysis techniques, an initial survey of the field might present a bewildering variety of approaches that, although algorithmically similar, are presented with different emphases, typically by people with mathematics backgrounds. We believe that multivariate analysis techniques have sufficient potential to warrant better dissemination. Researchers should be able to employ them in an informed and accessible manner. The following article attempts to provide a basic introduction with sample applications to simulated and real-world data sets.},

	issn = {14774054},
	doi = {10.1093/bib/bbx060},
	abstract = {The growing number of modalities (e.g. multi-omics, imaging and clinical data) characterizing a given disease provides physicians and statisticians with complementary facets reflecting the disease process but emphasizes the need for novel statistical methods of data analysis able to unify these views. Such data sets are indeed intrinsically structured in blocks, where each block represents a set of variables observed on a group of individuals. Therefore, classical statistical tools cannot be applied without altering their organization, with the risk of information loss. Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) and its sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (SGCCA) counterpart are component-based methods for exploratory analyses of data sets structured in blocks of variables. Rather than operating sequentially on parts of the measurements, the RGCCA/SGCCA-based integrative analysis method aims at summarizing the relevant information between and within the blocks. It processes a priori information defining which blocks are supposed to be linked to one another, thus reflecting hypotheses about the biology underlying the data blocks. It also requires the setting of extra parameters that need to be carefully adjusted. Here, we provide practical guidelines for the use of RGCCA/SGCCA. We also illustrate the flexibility and usefulness of RGCCA/SGCCA on a unique cohort of patients with four genetic subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia, in which we obtained multiple data sets from brain volumetry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and metabolomic and lipidomic analyses. As a first step toward the extraction of multimodal biomarkers, and through the reduction to a few meaningful components and the visualization of relevant variables, we identified possible markers of disease progression.},

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a promising analysis method that is being increasingly applied to fMRI data. A principal advantage of this approach is its applicability to cognitive paradigms for which detailed models of brain activity are not available. Independent component analysis has been successfully utilized to analyze single-subject fMRI data sets, and an extension of this work would be to provide for group inferences. However, unlike univariate methods (e.g., regression analysis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics), ICA does not naturally generalize to a method suitable for drawing inferences about groups of subjects. We introduce a novel approach for drawing group inferences using ICA of fMRI data, and present its application to a simple visual paradigm that alternately stimulates the left or right visual field. Our group ICA analysis revealed task-related components in left and right visual cortex, a transiently task-related component in bilateral occipital/parietal cortex, and a non-task-related component in bilateral visual association cortex. We address issues involved in the use of ICA as an fMRI analysis method such as: (1) How many components should be calculated? (2) How are these components to be combined across subjects? (3) How should the final results be thresholded and/or presented? We show that the methodology we present provides answers to these questions and lay out a process for making group inferences from fMRI data using independent component analysis.},

	issn = {1552-5260},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jalz.2009.05.319},
	abstract = {Background: Heterogeneity of histopathology across hippocampal sub fields has been reported in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, subfield-specific neu roimaging biomarkers could provide greater sensitivity over whole hippocampus volume measurements. An analysis of subfield level hippocampal volume atrophy in a small group of subjects is presented here. Sub field volumes are measured from in vivo images using normalization to a high resolution postmortem atlas. Methods: The data set consists of T1-weighted 3T MRI scans of 27 subjects - 11 controls and 16 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - at multiple time points, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Each subject's hippocampi are segmented from the baseline scan using a semi-automated protocol. Sub fields are labeled in each baseline scan using shape-based normalization to the postmortem atlas (Figure 1) containing subfield labels (Yushkevich et al., Neuroimage 44:2,385-398). Followup images are mapped to the baseline image using high-dimensional normalization, thus providing an estimate of the longitudinal volume change. Finally, subfield-specific atrophy rates are obtained by integrating the Jacobian of this intra-subject transformation over each subfield. Results: Longitudinal atrophy is observed throughout the hippocampus, but greater on average in MCI than the control group. CA1 has significantly higher atrophy in MCI compared to controls (p=0.02). The subfield label comprising stratum radiatum, stratum lacuno-sum-moleculare and vestigial hippocampal sulcus trends towards higher at rophy in MCI as well (p=0.09). Atrophy in CA2/3 (p=0.43) and DG (p=0.67) do not differ significantly between the two groups. However, within the MCI group, subjects with ApoE4/E4 genotype (6 subjects) have significantly higher (p=0.04) atrophy in CA2/3 than those with ApoE3/E3 (7 subjects) (Figure 2). Conclusions: Higher CA1 atrophy in MCI compared to controls and relative sparing of CA2/3 and DG have been reported by other researchers (Qiu et al., Neuroimage 40:1, 68-76; Apostolova et al., Arch. Neurol. 63:5, 693-699.). On the other hand, Mueller et al. found greater CA3 atrophy in subjects with ApoE4 genotype (Mueller et al., Neuroimage 42:1, 42-48). Our preliminary analysis replicates both of these results. This indicates that atlas-based subfield labeling techniques can potentially be used in clinical studies. However, the data set used is small and further val idation in a larger data set is required},

	abstract = {The present article briefs the papers which were featured in this issue of Developmental Science. Decades of work in the fields of sociology, education, and public health have demonstrated strong links between socioeconomic status (SES) and important measures of child development, such as IQ, grade retention, and school graduation rates. Such measures tell us in broad strokes that socioeconomic differences in childhood are linked to large differences in cognitive development and academic achievement. The emerging understanding of the which, when and how of poverty's effects on brain development can also encourage societal investment in child development by making clear the physical consequences of socioeconomic status on human capital. By placing the problem of child poverty and cognitive development in a biological framework, this issue highlights the public health aspect of a problem that has heretofore been viewed only in terms of social justice. The current vital state of SES research in neuroscience is a welcome development, which contrasts sharply with the skeptical, if not hostile, reception such work received less than a decade ago.

For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80\%, whereas in practice less than 40\% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor classification is inexact and largely dependent on the qualitative pathological examination of the images of the tumor tissue slides. In this study, our aim was to develop an automated computational method to classify Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) stained tissue sections based on cancer tissue texture features. METHODS: Image processing of histology slide images was used to detect and identify adipose tissue, extracellular matrix, morphologically distinct cell nuclei types, and the tubular architecture. The texture parameters derived from image analysis were then applied to classify images in a supervised classification scheme using histologic grade of a testing set as guidance. RESULTS: The histologic grade assigned by pathologists to invasive breast carcinoma images strongly correlated with both the presence and extent of cell nuclei with dispersed chromatin and the architecture, specifically the extent of presence of tubular cross sections. The two parameters that differentiated tumor grade found in this study were (1) the number density of cell nuclei with dispersed chromatin and (2) the number density of tubular cross sections identified through image processing as white blobs that were surrounded by a continuous string of cell nuclei. Classification based on subdivisions of a whole slide image containing a high concentration of cancer cell nuclei consistently agreed with the grade classification of the entire slide. CONCLUSION: The automated image analysis and classification presented in this study demonstrate the feasibility of developing clinically relevant classification of histology images based on micro- texture.

Each affine transform is defined on a local region and the resulting diffeomorphism encapsulates all the local transforms by a smooth and invertible displacement field. Compared with traditional weighting schemes used in combining local transforms, our new scheme guarantees that the resulting transform precisely preserves the value of each local affine transform. By introducing the trajectory of local regions instead of using regions themselves, the new approach encodes precisely each local affine transform using a diffeomorphism with one or more stationary velocity fields. Experiments show that our new polyaffine model is both accurate and efficient. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

In earlier work, we employed capacity-based reparameterization to co-register temporal sequences of 2-D coronal images of the human lungs. Here, we extend that work to the evaluation of a ventilator-acquired 3-D dataset from a normal mouse. Reparameterization according to both deformation and lung volume is evaluated. Both measures provide results that closely approximate normal physiological behavior, as judged from the original data. Our ultimate goal is to be able to characterize normal parenchymal biomechanics over a population of healthy individuals, and to use this statistical model to evaluate lung deformation under various pathological states. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btn526},
	abstract = {Motivation: Cis-acting regulatory elements are frequently constrained by both sequence content and positioning relative to a functional site, such as a splice or polyadenylation site. We describe an approach to regulatory motif analysis based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Whereas existing pattern recognition algorithms commonly focus primarily on sequence content, our method simultaneously characterizes both positioning and sequence content of putative motifs. Results: Tests on artificially generated sequences show that NMF can faithfully reproduce both positioning and content of test motifs. We show how the variation of the residual sum of squares can be used to give a robust estimate of the number of motifs or patterns in a sequence set. Our analysis distinguishes multiple motifs with significant overlap in sequence content and/or positioning. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the NMF approach through characterization of biologically interesting datasets. Specifically, an analysis of mRNA 3′-processing (cleavage and polyadenylation) sites from a broad range of higher eukaryotes reveals a conserved core pattern of three elements. © 2008 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Nonlinear registration of individual brain MRI scans to standard brain templates is common practice in neuroimaging and multiple registration algorithms have been developed and refined over the last 20 years. However, little has been done to quantitatively compare the available algorithms and much of that work has exclusively focused on cortical structures given their importance in the fMRI literature. In contrast, for clinical applications such as functional neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS), proper alignment of subcortical structures between template and individual space is important. This allows for atlas-based segmentations of anatomical DBS targets such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal pallidum (GPi). Here, we systematically evaluated the performance of six modern and established algorithms on subcortical normalization and segmentation results by calculating over 11,000 nonlinear warps in over 100 subjects. For each algorithm, we evaluated its performance using T1-or T2-weighted acquisitions alone or a combination of T1-, T2-and PD-weighted acquisitions in parallel. Furthermore, we present optimized parameters for the best performing algorithms. We tested each algorithm on two datasets, a state-of-the-art MRI cohort of young subjects and a cohort of subjects age- and MR-quality-matched to a typical DBS Parkinson's Disease cohort. Our final pipeline is able to segment DBS targets with precision comparable to manual expert segmentations in both cohorts. Although the present study focuses on the two prominent DBS targets, STN and GPi, these methods may extend to other small subcortical structures like thalamic nuclei or the nucleus accumbens.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging data embodies a massive multiple testing problem, where 100,000 correlated test statistics must be assessed. The familywise error rate, the chance of any false positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

	issn = {15491277},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.0040230},
	abstract = {Background: RPE65 is an essential molecule in the retinoid-visual cycle, and RPE65 gene mutations cause the congenital human blindness known as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Somatic gene therapy delivered to the retina of blind dogs with an RPE65 mutation dramatically restores retinal physiology and has sparked international interest in human treatment trials for this incurable disease. An unanswered question is how the visual cortex responds after prolonged sensory deprivation from retinal dysfunction. We therefore studied the cortex of RPE65-mutant dogs before and after retinal gene therapy. Then, we inquired whether there is visual pathway integrity and responsivity in adult humans with LCA due to RPE65 mutations (RPE65-LCA). Methods and Findings: RPE65-mutant dogs were studied with fMRI. Prior to therapy, retinal and subcortical responses to light were markedly diminished, and there were minimal cortical responses within the primary visual areas of the lateral gyrus (activation amplitude mean ± standard deviation [SD] = 0.07\% ± 0.06\% and volume = 1.3 ± 0.6 cm3). Following therapy, retinal and subcortical response restoration was accompanied by increased amplitude (0.18\% ± 0.06\%) and volume (8.2 ± 0.8 cm3) of activation within the lateral gyrus (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.005 for both). Cortical recovery occurred rapidly (within a month of treatment) and was persistent (as long as 2.5 y after treatment). Recovery was present even when treatment was provided as late as 1-4 y of age. Human RPE65-LCA patients (ages 18-23 y) were studied with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Optic nerve diameter (3.2 ± 0.5 mm) was within the normal range (3.2 ± 0.3 mm), and occipital cortical white matter density as judged by voxel-based morphometry was slightly but significantly altered (1.3 SD below control average, p = 0.005). Functional magnetic resonance imaging in human RPE65-LCA patients revealed cortical responses with a markedly diminished activation volume (8.8 ± 1.2 cm 3) compared to controls (29.7 ± 8.3 cm3, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) when stimulated with lower intensity light. Unexpectedly, cortical response volume (41.2 ± 11.1 cm3) was comparable to normal (48.8 ± 3.1 cm3, p = 0.2) with higher intensity light stimulation. Conclusions: Visual cortical responses dramatically improve after retinal gene therapy in the canine model of RPE65-LCA. Human RPE65-LCA patients have preserved visual pathway anatomy and detectable cortical activation despite limited visual experience. Taken together, the results support the potential for human visual benefit from retinal therapies currently being aimed at restoring vision to the congenitally blind with genetic retinal disease. © 2007 Aguirre et al.},

We also measured gray and white matter volumes for each subject. The results indicated that chimpanzees showed significant regional variation in cortical thickness with lower values in primary motor and sensory cortex compared with association cortex. Furthermore, chimpanzees showed significant rightward asymmetries in cortical thickness for a number of regions of interest throughout the cortex and leftward asymmetries in white but not gray matter volume. We also found that total and region-specific cortical thickness was significantly negatively correlated with white matter volume. Thus, chimpanzees with greater white matter volumes had thinner cortical thickness.

	abstract = {Quantifiers are very common in everyday speech, but we know little about their cognitive basis or neural representation. The present study examined comprehension of three classes of quantifiers that depend on different cognitive components in patients with focal neurodegenerative diseases. Patients evaluated the truth-value of a sentence containing a quantifier relative to a picture illustrating a small number of familiar objects, and performance was related to MRI grey matter atrophy using voxel-based morphometry. We found that patients with corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) are significantly impaired in their comprehension of cardinal quantifiers (e.g. " At least three birds are on the branch" ), due in part to their deficit in quantity knowledge. MRI analyses related this deficit to temporal-parietal atrophy found in CBS/PCA. We also found that patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are significantly impaired in their comprehension of logical quantifiers (e.g. " Some of the birds are on the branch" ), associated with a simple form of perceptual logic, and this correlated with their deficit on executive measures. This deficit was related to disease in rostral prefrontal cortex in bvFTD. These patients were also impaired in their comprehension of majority quantifiers (e.g. " At least half of the birds are on the branch" ), and this too was correlated with their deficit on executive measures. This was related to disease in the basal ganglia interrupting a frontal-striatal loop critical for executive functioning. These findings suggest that a large-scale frontal-parietal neural network plays a crucial role in quantifier comprehension, and that comprehension of specific classes of quantifiers may be selectively impaired in patients with focal neurodegenerative conditions in these areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine the frequency and stability over time of the subgroup characterization of the tremor dominant (TD) versus postural instability gait disorder dominant (PIGD) Parkinson's disease (PD) in de novo patients. Background: There is a substantial body of literature on the clinical sub classification of PD into TD versus PIGD subtype. However, there are limited data on the stability of this classification especially in early disease. Methods: Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is a longitudinal case control study of de novo, untreated PD participants at enrollment. Participants undergo a number of assessments including the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). TD versus PIGD subtype was defined based on the previously published formula. We report one-year analysis data. Results: 320 of 423 PD recruited subjects had data on subtype classification at year 1 and were included in the analysis. 228 (71\%) were classified as TD, 56 (18\%) as PIGD and 36 (11\%) as indeterminate at baseline. At 12 months, 39\% PIGD and 18\% TD shifted subtypes: 29\% PIGD shifted to TD and 11\% to Indeterminate; 10\% TD shifted to PIGD and 8\% to Indeterminate. The classification was not affected by the dopaminergic treatment (p = 0.59). Conclusions: TD versus PIGD subtype classification has substantial variability over first year in PD de novo cohort specifically for PIGD subtype. Dopaminergic therapy does not impact the change of the PD subtype. This instability has to be taken into consideration specifically when establishing correlations with the biomarkers and for long term prognostication.},

The results of the current project suggest that a major factor contributing to the discrepancy is the masking of age-related declines in longitudinal comparisons by large positive effects associated with prior test experience. Results from three methods of estimating retest effects in this project, together with results from studies comparing non-human animals raised in constant environments and from studies examining neurobiological variables not susceptible to retest effects, converge on a conclusion that some aspects of age-related cognitive decline begin in healthy educated adults when they are in their 20s and 30s. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Various public and private sector industries generate, store, and analyze big data with an aim to improve the services they provide. In the healthcare industry, various sources for big data include hospital records, medical records of patients, results of medical examinations, and devices that are a part of internet of things. Biomedical research also generates a significant portion of big data relevant to public healthcare. This data requires proper management and analysis in order to derive meaningful information. Otherwise, seeking solution by analyzing big data quickly becomes comparable to finding a needle in the haystack. There are various challenges associated with each step of handling big data which can only be surpassed by using high-end computing solutions for big data analysis. That is why, to provide relevant solutions for improving public health, healthcare providers are required to be fully equipped with appropriate infrastructure to systematically generate and analyze big data. An efficient management, analysis, and interpretation of big data can change the game by opening new avenues for modern healthcare. That is exactly why various industries, including the healthcare industry, are taking vigorous steps to convert this potential into better services and financial advantages.

The image is treated as a graph from which the user selects seed points to be connected via 1-dimensional paths. A variant of Dijkstra's algorithm both grows the segmenting surface from initial seeds and connects them with a minimal path computation. The technique is local and does not require examination or pre-processing of the entire volume. The surface propagation is controlled by iterative computation of border probabilities. As expanding regions meet, the statistics collected during propagation are passed to an active minimal-path generation module which links the associating points through the vessel tree. We provide a probabilistic basis for the volume search and path- finding speed functions and then apply the algorithm to phantom and real data sets.

Our main objective was to determine the correspondence between changes in the substantia nigra, evident in neuromelanin and iron sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dopaminergic striatal innervation loss in patients with PD. Eighteen patients and 18 healthy control subjects were included in the study. Using neuromelanin-MRI, we measured the volume of the substantia nigra and the contrast-to-noise-ratio between substantia nigra and a background region. The apparent transverse relaxation rate and magnetic susceptibility of the substantia nigra were calculated from dual-echo MRI. Striatal dopaminergic innervation was measured as density of dopamine transporter (DAT) by means of single-photon emission computed tomography and [123I] N-ømega-fluoropropyl-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-iodophenyl) tropane. Patients showed a reduced volume of the substantia nigra and contrast-to-noise-ratio and both positively correlated with the corresponding striatal DAT density. The apparent transverse relaxation rate and magnetic susceptibility values of the substantia nigra did not differ between patients and healthy controls. The best predictor of DAT reduction was the volume of the substantia nigra. Clinical and imaging correlations were also investigated for the locus coeruleus. Our results suggest that neuromelanin-MRI can be used for quantifying substantia nigra pathology in PD where it closely correlates with dopaminergic striatal innervation loss. Longitudinal studies should further explore the role of Neuromelanin-MRI as an imaging biomarker of PD, especially for subjects at risk of developing the disease.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the cognitive and neural basis for nonfluent speech in progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). Background: Nonfluent speech is the hallmark feature of PNFA, and this has been attributed to impairments in syntactic processing, motor-speech planning, and executive functioning that also occur in these patients. Patients with PNFA have left inferior frontal atrophy. Methods: A large semi-structured speech sample and neuropsychological measures of language and executive functioning were examined in 16 patients with PNFA, 12 patients with behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and 13 age-matched controls. Speech fluency was quantified as words per minute (WPM) in the semi-structured speech sample. Stepwise linear regression analyses were used to relate WPM to grammatic, motor-speech planning, and executive aspects of patient functioning. These measures were then related to cortical thickness in 8 patients with PNFA and 7 patients with bvFTD using structural MRI. Results: WPM was significantly reduced in patients with PNFA relative to controls and patients with bvFTD. Regression analyses revealed that only grammatic measures predicted WPM in PNFA, whereas executive measures were the only significant predictor of WPM in bvFTD. Cortical thinning was significant in PNFA relative to controls in left inferior frontal and anterior-superior temporal regions, and a regression analysis related this area to reduced WPM in PNFA. Significant cortical thinning associated with limited grammatic processing also was seen in the left inferior frontal-superior temporal region in PNFA, and this overlapped with the area of frontal-temporal thinning related to reduced WPM. Conclusion: Nonfluent speech in PNFA may be due in part to difficulty with grammatic processing associated with left inferior frontal and anterior-superior temporal disease.

	abstract = {Non-invasive measurement of resting state cerebral blood flow (CBF) may reflect alterations of brain structure and function after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, previous imaging studies of resting state brain in chronic TBI have been limited by several factors, including measurement in relative rather than absolute units, use of crude spatial registration methods, exclusion of subjects with substantial focal lesions, and exposure to ionizing radiation, which limits repeated assessments. This study aimed to overcome those obstacles by measuring absolute CBF with an arterial spin labeling perfusion fMRI technique, and using an image preprocessing protocol that is optimized for brains with mixed diffuse and focal injuries characteristic of moderate and severe TBI. Resting state CBF was quantified in 27 individuals with moderate to severe TBI in the chronic stage, and 22 demographically matched healthy controls. In addition to global CBF reductions in the TBI subjects, more prominent regional hypoperfusion was found in the posterior cingulate cortices, the thalami, and multiple locations in the frontal cortices. Diffuse injury, as assessed by tensor-based morphometry, was mainly associated with reduced CBF in the posterior cingulate cortices and the thalami, where the greatest volume losses were detected. Hypoperfusion in superior and middle frontal cortices, in contrast, was associated with focal lesions. These results suggest that structural lesions, both focal and diffuse, are the main contributors to the absolute CBF alterations seen in chronic TBI, and that CBF may serve as a tool to assess functioning neuronal volume. We also speculate that resting reductions in posterior cingulate perfusion may reflect alterations in the default-mode network, and may contribute to the attentional deficits common in TBI.

By interpreting PCA as density estimation, we show how to use Bayesian model selection to estimate the true dimensionality of the data. The resulting estimate is simple to compute yet guaranteed to pick the correct dimensionality, given enough data. The estimate involves an integral over the Steifel manifold of k-frames, which is difficult to compute exactly. But after choosing an appropriate parameterization and applying Laplace's method, an accurate and practical estimator is obtained. In simulations, it is convincingly better than cross-validation and other proposed algorithms, plus it runs much faster.},

Using multi-atlas segmentation and machine learning-based correction, we were able to produce automated amygdala segments with high Dice (Mean=0.918 for the left amygdala; 0.916 for the right amygdala) and Jaccard coefficients (Mean=0.850 for the left; 0.846 for the right) compared to rigorously hand-traced volumes. This automated routine also produced amygdala segments with high intra-class correlations (consistency=0.830, absolute agreement=0.819 for the left; consistency=0.786, absolute agreement=0.783 for the right) and bivariate (r =0.831 for the left; r =0.797 for the right) compared to handdrawn amygdala. Our results are discussed in relation to other cutting-edge segmentation techniques, as well as commonly available approaches to amygdala segmentation (e.g., Freesurfer). We believe this new technique has broad application to research with large sample sizes for which amygdala quantification might be needed. © 2012 Hanson, Suh, Nacewicz, Sutterer, Cayo, Stodola, Burghy, Wang, Avants, Yushkevich, Essex, Pollak and Davidson.},

Our experiments suggest that the choice of neighborhood in discrete extrema detection has a strong impact on image registration accuracy. In head MR images, the brain is registered to a labeled atlas with an average Dice coefficient of 92\%, outperforming registration from mutual information as well as an existing 3D SIFT implementation. In abdominal CT images, the spine is registered with an average error of 4.82 mm. Furthermore, keypoints are matched with high precision in simulated head MR images exhibiting lesions from multiple sclerosis.

We apply this algorithm to estimating a putative evolutionary change of coordinates between a population of chimpanzee and human cortices. Inter-species functional homologues fix the map explicitly, where they are known, while image similarities guide the alignment elsewhere. This map allows detailed study of the volumetric change between chimp and human cortex. Instead of basing the inter-species study on a single species atlas, we diffeomorphically connect the mean shape and intensity templates for each group. The human statistics then map diffeomorphically into the space of the chimpanzee cortex providing a comparison between species.

	abstract = {Introduction: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) present a variety of non-motor symptoms. However, it remains unclear whether dopamine depletion is related to non-motor symptoms, and which non-motor symptoms are significantly dependent on dopaminergic deficit. Methods: Forty-one patients with PD who underwent positron emission tomography imaging of dopamine transporters (DATs) were recruited for this study. The striatum was divided into 12 subregions, and DAT activity, as striatal dopaminergic concentration, was calculated in each subregion. In addition to measuring motor symptoms using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-part III (UPDRS-III), various non-motor symptoms were assessed using the Montreal cognitive assessment, frontal assessment battery, Beck depression inventory (BDI), Beck anxiety inventory, PD sleep scale (PDSS), PD fatigue scale, and non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) for PD. Results: For simple linear regression analyses, dopaminergic depletion in all striatal subregions was negatively correlated with the UPDRS-III score. The most relevant non-motor symptom assessment related to dopaminergic loss in the 12 subregions was NMSS, followed by BDI and PDSS. However, following multiple linear regression analyses, dopaminergic depletion in the 12 striatal subregions was not related with any of the non-motor symptoms. Conversely, dopaminergic deficit in the right anterior and posterior putamen was associated with the UPDRS-III score. Conclusions: Striatal dopaminergic depletion was not significantly correlated with any of the various non-motor symptoms in PD. Our findings suggest that non-dopaminergic systems are significantly implicated in the pathogenesis of non-motor symptoms in patients with PD.},

Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is a functional imaging method which allows for encoding of a grid of signal voids on cardiac MR images, providing a mechanism for noninvasive measurement of intramural tissue deformations, in vivo. We present a novel technique of employing a four-dimensional (4-D) B-spline model which permits concurrent determination of myocardial beads and myocardial strains. The method entails fitting the knot planes of the 4-D B-spline model for fixed times to a sequence of triplets of orthogonal sets of tag surfaces for all imaged volumetric frames within the constraints of the model's spatio-temporal internal energy. From a three-dimensional (3-D) displacement field, the corresponding long and short-axis Lagrangian normal, shear, and principal strain maps are produced. As an important byproduct, the points defined by the 3-D intersections of the triplets of orthogonal tag planes, which we refer to as myocardial beads, can easily be determined by our model. Displaying the beads as a movie loop allows for the visualization of the nonrigid movement of the left ventricle in 3-D.},

	abstract = {Many real-world applications propose the request for sharing knowledge among different tasks or datasets. Transfer learning has been proposed to solve this kind of problems and it has been successfully applied in supervised learning and semi-supervised learning settings. However, its adoption in clustering, one of the most classical research problems in machine learning and data mining, is still scarce. Spectral clustering, as a major clustering algorithm with wide applications and better performance than k-means typically, has not been well incorporated with knowledge transfer. In this paper, we first consider the problem of learning from only one auxiliary unlabeled dataset for spectral clustering and propose a novel algorithm called transfer spectral clustering (TSC). Then, it is extended to the settings with multiple auxiliary tasks. TSC assumes the feature embeddings being shared with the auxiliary tasks and utilizes co-clustering to extract useful information from the auxiliary datasets to improve the clustering performance. TSC involves not only the data manifold information of individual task but also the feature manifold information shared between related tasks. An in-depth explanation of our algorithm together with a convergence analysis are provided. As demonstrated by the extensive experiments, TSC can effectively improve the clustering performance by using auxiliary unlabeled data when compared with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.},

Standard voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyzes imaging data voxel-by-voxel—and follows this with cluster-based or voxel-wise multiple comparisons correction methods to determine significance. Eigenanatomy reverses the standard order of operations by first clustering the voxel data and then using standard linear regression in this reduced dimensionality space. As with traditional region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, this strategy can greatly improve detection power. Our results show that eigenanatomy provides a principled objective function that leads to localized, data-driven regions of interest. These regions improve our ability to quantify biologically plausible rates of cortical change in two distinct forms of neurodegeneration.

To investigate whether these deficits are coupled with atrophy of memory-related brain regions, T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired and volumes of the cerebrum, ventricles, prefrontal cortex (PFC), calcarine cortex, hippocampus, and striatum were quantified in young and aged rhesus monkeys. Subjects were tested on a spatiotemporal memory procedure (delayed response [DR]) that requires the integrity of the PFC and a medial temporal lobe-dependent recognition memory task (delayed nonmatching to sample [DNMS]). Region of interest analyses revealed that age inversely correlated with striatal, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex volumes. Hippocampal volume predicted acquisition of the DR task. Striatal volume correlated with DNMS acquisition, whereas total prefrontal gray matter, prefrontal white matter, and dlPFC volumes each predicted DNMS accuracy. A regional covariance analysis revealed that age-related volumetric changes could be captured in a distributed network that was coupled with declining performance across delays on the DNMS task. This volumetric analysis adds to growing evidence that cognitive aging in primates arises from region-specific morphometric alterations distributed across multiple memory-related brain systems, including subdivisions of the PFC.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing effort to analyze the morphometry of hippocampal subfields using both in vivo and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, given that boundaries between subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) are conventionally defined on the basis of microscopic features that often lack discernible signature in MRI, subfield delineation in MRI literature has largely relied on heuristic geometric rules, the validity of which with respect to the underlying anatomy is largely unknown. The development and evaluation of such rules are challenged by the limited availability of data linking MRI appearance to microscopic hippocampal anatomy, particularly in three dimensions (3D). The present paper, for the first time, demonstrates the feasibility of labeling hippocampal subfields in a high resolution volumetric MRI dataset based directly on microscopic features extracted from histology. It uses a combination of computational techniques and manual post-processing to map subfield boundaries from a stack of histology images (obtained with 200. μm spacing and 5. μm slice thickness; stained using the Kluver-Barrera method) onto a postmortem 9.4. Tesla MRI scan of the intact, whole hippocampal formation acquired with 160. μm isotropic resolution. The histology reconstruction procedure consists of sequential application of a graph-theoretic slice stacking algorithm that mitigates the effects of distorted slices, followed by iterative affine and diffeomorphic co-registration to postmortem MRI scans of approximately 1. cm-thick tissue sub-blocks acquired with 200. μm isotropic resolution. These 1. cm blocks are subsequently co-registered to the MRI of the whole HF. Reconstruction accuracy is evaluated as the average displacement error between boundaries manually delineated in both the histology and MRI following the sequential stages of reconstruction. The methods presented and evaluated in this single-subject study can potentially be applied to multiple hippocampal tissue samples in order to construct a histologically informed MRI atlas of the hippocampal formation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Methods: Florbetapir PET SUVR was calculated at baseline (screening) and Weeks 26 and 54 for patients randomized to placebo and each of four aducanumab doses (1, 3, 6, and 10 mg/kg), using whole cerebellum, cerebellar grey matter, cerebellar white matter, pons, and subcortical white matter as reference regions. In addition to the pre-specified composite cortex target ROI, individual cerebral cortical ROIs were assessed as targets. Results: Of the reference regions used, subcortical white matter, cerebellum white matter, or pons, alone or in combination, generated the largest effect sizes. The use of anterior cingulate cortex as target ROI resulted in greater effect sizes than composite cortex. SUVR calculations were not affected by correction for brain volume change over time. Conclusion: Dose- and time-dependent reductions in amyloid PET SUVR were consistently observed with aducanumab only in cortical regions prone to amyloid plaque deposition, regardless of amyloid-plaque-devoid reference region used. These data support the hypothesis that florbetapir SUVR responses associated with aducanumab treatment are a result of specific dose- and time-dependent reductions in amyloid burden in patients with AD.},

Currently, it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three normalization methods representing the current range of available approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy (FA), high-dimensional normalization using the FA, and high-dimensional normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the alignment of WM tracts. © 2007 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Identifying associations between genetic variants and neuroimaging quantitative traits (QTs) is a popular research topic in brain imaging genetics. Sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) has been widely used to reveal complex multi-SNP-multi-QT associations. Several SCCA methods explicitly incorporate prior knowledge into the model and intend to uncover the hidden structure informed by the prior knowledge. We propose a novel structured SCCA method using Graph constrained Elastic-Net (GraphNet) regularizer to not only discover important associations, but also induce smoothness between coefficients that are adjacent in the graph. In addition, the proposed method incorporates the covariance structure information usually ignored by most SCCA methods. Experiments on simulated and real imaging genetic data show that, the proposed method not only outperforms a widely used SCCA method but also yields an easy-to-interpret biological findings.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report the set-up and results of the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2012 and 2013 conferences. Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients - manually annotated by up to four raters - and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74\%-85\%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

	abstract = {We present a parallel distributed-memory algorithm for large deformation diffeomorphic registration of volumetric images that produces large isochoric deformations (locally volume preserving). Image registration is a key technology in medical image analysis. Our algorithm uses a partial differential equation constrained optimal control formulation. Finding the optimal deformation map requires the solution of a highly nonlinear problem that involves pseudo-differential operators, biharmonic operators, and pure advection operators both forward and backward in time. A key issue is the time to solution, which poses the demand for efficient optimization methods as well as an effective utilization of high performance computing resources. To address this problem we use a preconditioned, inexact, Gauss-Newton-Krylov solver. Our algorithm integrates several components: A spectral discretization in space, a semi-Lagrangian formulation in time, analytic adjoints, different regularization functionals (including volume-preserving ones), a spectral preconditioner, a highly optimized distributed Fast Fourier Transform, and a cubic interpolation scheme for the semi-Lagrangian time-stepping. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm on images with resolution of up to 10243 on the 'Maverick' and 'Stampede' systems at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). The critical problem in the medical imaging application domain is strong scaling, that is, solving registration problems of a moderate size of 2563- A typical resolution for medical images. We are able to solve the registration problem for images of this size in less than five seconds on 64 x86 nodes of TACC's 'Maverick' system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traditional methods of dating a pregnancy based on history or sonographic assessment have a large variation in the third trimester. We aimed to assess the ability of various quantitative measures of brain cortical folding on MR imaging in determining fetal gestational age in the third trimester. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 8 different quantitative cortical folding measures to predict gestational age i n 33 healthy fetuses by using T2-weighted fetal MR imaging. We compared the accuracy of the prediction of gestational age by these cortical folding measures with the accuracy of prediction by brain volume measurement and by a previously reported semiquantitative visual scale of brain maturity. Regression models were constructed, and measurement biases and variances were determined via a cross-validation procedure. RESULTS: The cortical folding measures are accurate in the estimation and prediction of gestational age (mean of the absolute error, 0.43 ± 0.45 weeks) and perform better than (P = .024) brain volume (mean of the absolute error, 0.72 ± 0.61 weeks) or sonography measures (SDs approximately 1.5 weeks, as reported in literature). Prediction accuracy is comparable with that of the semiquantitative visual assessment score (mean, 0.57 ± 0.41 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative cortical folding measures such as global average curvedness can be an accurate and reliable estimator of gestational age and brain maturity for healthy fetuses in the third trimester and have the potential to be an indicator of brain-growth delays for at-risk fetuses and preterm neonates.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we give a short introduction to machine learning and survey its applications in radiology. We focused on six categories of applications in radiology: medical image segmentation, registration, computer aided detection and diagnosis, brain function or activity analysis and neurological disease diagnosis from fMR images, content-based image retrieval systems for CT or MRI images, and text analysis of radiology reports using natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU). This survey shows that machine learning plays a key role in many radiology applications. Machine learning identifies complex patterns automatically and helps radiologists make intelligent decisions on radiology data such as conventional radiographs, CT, MRI, and PET images and radiology reports. In many applications, the performance of machine learning-based automatic detection and diagnosis systems has shown to be comparable to that of a well-trained and experienced radiologist. Technology development in machine learning and radiology will benefit from each other in the long run. Key contributions and common characteristics of machine learning techniques in radiology are discussed. We also discuss the problem of translating machine learning applications to the radiology clinical setting, including advantages and potential barriers. ?? 2012 .},

The aim of the current research was to test the hypothesis that concept formation deficits associated with an extramotor neurocognitive network involving executive and semantic resources can be found in some ALS patients. Method: Forty-one patients with clinically definite ALS were assessed with Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Sorting Test (D-KEFS), a measure of concept formation requiring patients to manipulate verbal and visual semantic information and neuropsychological tests measuring naming, semantic memory, and executive control. Using D-KEFS scale scores, a k-mean cluster analysis specifying a 3-group solution was able to classify ALS patients into groups presenting with mildly impaired, average, and above average sorting test performance. High-resolution T1 structural MRI was used to examine cortical thickness in a subset of 16 ALS patients. Results: Stepwise regression analyses related free and recognition sorting test performance to measures of action naming, single word semantic knowledge, and mental search/working memory. MRI studies found widespread cortical thinning involving bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Regression analyses related recognition sorting performance to reduced MRI cortical thickness involving the left prefrontal and left parietal cortex. Conclusions: An extramotor cognitive network is associated with impaired concept formation in ALS. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

The method makes no assumptions about topology, instead constructing a local neighborhood from image information, such as a segmentation or edge map, to define a surface patch. Neighborhood constructions using extrinsic and intrinsic distances are given. This representation allows one to estimate differential properties directly from the image's Gauss map. We develop a novel technique for this purpose which estimates the shape operator and yields both principal directions and curvatures. Only first derivatives need be estimated, making the method numerically stable. We show the use of these measures for multi-scale classification of image structure by the mean and Gaussian curvatures. Finally, we propose to register image volumes by surface curvature. This is particularly useful when geometry is the only variable. To illustrate this, we register binary segmented data by surface curvature, both rigidly and non-rigidly. A novel variant of Demons registration, extensible for use with differentiable similarity metrics, is also applied for deformable curvature-driven registration of medical images. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

We incorporate an accessible approach for simultaneously scanning multiple ex vivo brains, requiring only a 3D-printed brain holder, and novel image processing steps for their separation and orientation. We employ clinically established multi-atlas techniques-superior to single-atlas methods-together with publicly-available atlas databases for automatic skull-stripping and tissue segmentation, providing high-quality, subject-specific tissue maps. We follow these steps with group-wise registration, structural parcellation and both Voxel- and Tensor-Based Morphometry-advanta-geous for their ability to highlight morphological differences without the laborious delineation of regions of interest. We show the application of freely available open-source software developed for clinical MRI analysis to mouse brain data: NiftySeg for segmentation and NiftyReg for registration, and discuss atlases and parameters suitable for the preclinical paradigm.

High-throughput methods permit genome-wide searches to discover genes that are uniquely expressed In brain circuits and regions that control behavior. Previous gene expression mapping studies in model organisms have employed In situ hybridization (ISH), a technique that uses labeled nucleic acid probes to bind to specific mRNA transcripts In tissue sections. A key requirement for this effort is the development of fast and robust algorithms for anatomically mapping and quantifying gene expression for ISH. We describe a neuroinformatics pipeline for automatically mapping expression profiles of ISH data and Its use to produce the first genomic scale 3D mapping of gene expression In a mammalian brain. The pipeline is fully automated and adaptable to other organisms and tissues. Our automated study of more than 20,000 genes Indicates that at least 78.8 percent are expressed at some level In the adult C56BL/6J mouse brain.

Implementing these large-p-with-small-n regressions poses several statistical and computational challenges, some of which can be confronted using Bayesian methods. This approach allows integrating various parametric and nonparametric shrinkage and variable selection procedures in a unified and consistent manner. The BGLR R-package implements a large collection of Bayesian regression models, including parametric variable selection and shrinkage methods and semiparametric procedures (Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regressions, RKHS). The software was originally developed for genomic applications; however, the methods implemented are useful for many nongenomic applications as well. The response can be continuous (censored or not) or categorical (either binary or ordinal). The algorithm is based on a Gibbs sampler with scalar updates and the implementation takes advantage of efficient compiled C and Fortran routines.

	abstract = {Background The anatomy of the substantia nigra on conventional MRI is controversial. Even using histological techniques it is difficult to delineate with certainty from surrounding structures. We sought to define the anatomy of the SN using high field spin-echo MRI of pathological material in which we could study the anatomy in detail to corroborate our MRI findings in controls and Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Methods 23 brains were selected from the Queen Square Brain Bank (10 controls, 8 progressive supranuclear palsy, 5 Parkinson's disease) and imaged using high field 9.4 Tesla spin-echo MRI. Subsequently brains were cut and stained with Luxol fast blue, Perls stain, and immunohistochemistry for substance P and calbindin. Once the anatomy was defined on histology the dimensions and volume of the substantia nigra were determined on high field magnetic resonance images. Results The anterior border of the substantia nigra was defined by the crus cerebri. In the medial half it was less distinct due to the deposition of iron and the interdigitation of white matter and the substantia nigra. The posterior border was flanked by white matter bridging the red nucleus and substantia nigra and seen as hypointense on spin-echo magnetic resonance images. Within the substantia nigra high signal structures corresponded to confirmed nigrosomes. These were still evident in Parkinson's disease but not in progressive supranuclear palsy. The volume and dimensions of the substantia nigra were similar in Parkinson's disease and controls, but reduced in progressive supranuclear palsy. Conclusions We present a histologically validated anatomical description of the substantia nigra on high field spin-echo high resolution magnetic resonance images and were able to delineate all five nigrosomes. In accordance with the pathological literature we did not observe changes in the nigrosome structure as manifest by volume or signal characteristics within the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease whereas in progressive supranuclear palsy there was microarchitectural destruction.},

Due to the insights gained from "big data" efforts, such as ADNI, automation of these techniques is an absolute necessity. Method We detail a significant modification of the ASHS (Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields) framework [1] made available as open source through the well-known Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and its R-based extension, ANTsR. Innovations include a new joint label fusion implementation with the use of non-negative least squares for weighting of individual atlases and subsequent refinement employs a four-class random forest approach based on true/false x positive/negative classifications. A leave-one-out evaluation was performed on two data sets (one public and one private) consisting of separate subparcellation schemes (denoted as "Penn" and "UCI"). Results Warping of individual atlases to the target image resulted in an average Dice value over all labels: Penn: left = 0.587, right = 0.570 and UCI: left = 0.667, right = 0.680. NNLS JLF: Penn: left = 0.751, right = 0.744 and UCI: left = 0.776, right = 0.779. RF Refinement: Penn: left = 0.762, right = 0.754 and UCI: left = 0.793, right = 0.785.

	abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts- based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

Voxelwise t tests performed over the determinant values demonstrated that females had a larger splenium than males (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons) while males possessed a larger genu (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). In addition, pointwise Pearson plots using age as a correlate showed a different pattern of age-related changes in male and female callosa, with female splenia tending to expand more with age, while the male genu tended to contract.

	abstract = {A progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) is considered the main feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent neuropathological evidence however suggests that the axons of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system are the earliest target of alpha-synuclein accumulation in PD, thus the principal site for vulnerability. Whether this applies to in vivo PD, and also to the mesolimbic system has not been investigated yet. We used [11C]FeCIT PET to measure presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) activity in both nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems, in 36 early PD patients (mean disease duration in months 10.7) and 14 healthy controls similar for age. We also performed anatomically-driven partial correlation analysis to evaluate possible changes in the connectivity within both the dopamine networks at an early clinical phase. In the nigrostriatal system, we found a severe DAT reduction in the afferents to the dorsal putamen (DPU) (η2= 0.84), whereas the SN was the less affected region (η2=0.31). DAT activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the ventral striatum (VST) were also reduced in the patient group, but to a lesser degree (VST η2=0.71 and VTA η2=0.31). In the PD patients compared to the controls, there was a marked decrease in dopamine network connectivity between SN and DPU nodes, supporting the significant derangement in the nigrostriatal pathway. These results suggest that neurodegeneration in the dopamine pathways is initially more prominent in the afferent axons and more severe in the nigrostriatal system. Considering PD as a disconnection syndrome starting from the axons, it would justify neuroprotective interventions even if patients have already manifested clinical symptoms.},

On the other hand, high-dimensional machine learning techniques do not typically provide a direct method for discovering which parts of the brain are used for making predictions. We present a framework, based on recent work in sparse linear regression, that addresses both drawbacks of mass univariate approaches, while preserving the direct spatial interpretability that they provide. In addition, we present a novel optimization algorithm that adapts the conjugate gradient method for sparse regression on medical imaging data.

	abstract = {Structured sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) models have been used to identify imaging genetic associations. These models either use group lasso or graph-guided fused lasso to conduct feature selection and feature grouping simultaneously. The group lasso based methods require prior knowledge to define the groups, which limits the capability when prior knowledge is incomplete or unavailable. The graph-guided methods overcome this drawback by using the sample correlation to define the constraint. However, they are sensitive to the sign of the sample correlation, which could introduce undesirable bias if the sign is wrongly estimated. We introduce a novel SCCA model with a new penalty, and develop an efficient optimization algorithm. Our method has a strong upper bound for the grouping effect for both positively and negatively correlated features. We show that our method performs better than or equally to three competing SCCA models on both synthetic and real data. In particular, our method identifies stronger canonical correlations and better canonical loading patterns, showing its promise for revealing interesting imaging genetic associations.

The results are first discussed from macro to micro level of organization (i.e., (1) structural; (2) functional; and (3) molecular) and then by applied imaging methodology. Findings: Several neuroimaging methods including diffusion imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) distinguish specific PD motor subtypes well, although findings are mixed. Furthermore, our review demonstrates that nTD-PD patients have more severe neuroalterations compared to TD-PD patients. More specifically, nTD-PD patients have deficits within striato-thalamo-cortical (STC) circuitry and other thalamocortical projections related to cognitive and sensorimotor function, while TD-PD patients tend to have greater cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuitry dysfunction. Conclusions: Based on the literature, STC and CTC circuitry deficits seem to be the key features of PD and the subtypes. Future research should make greater use of multimodal neuroimaging and techniques that have higher sensitivity in delineating subcortical structures involved in motor diseases.},

	abstract = {Structural brain changes along the lineage leading to modern Homo sapiens contributed to our distinctive cognitive and social abilities. However, the evolutionarily relevant molecular variants impacting key aspects of neuroanatomy are largely unknown. Here, we integrate evolutionary annotations of the genome at diverse timescales with common variant associations from large-scale neuroimaging genetic screens. We find that alleles with evidence of recent positive polygenic selection over the past 2000-3000 years are associated with increased surface area (SA) of the entire cortex, as well as specific regions, including those involved in spoken language and visual processing. Therefore, polygenic selective pressures impact the structure of specific cortical areas even over relatively recent timescales. Moreover, common sequence variation within human gained enhancers active in the prenatal cortex is associated with postnatal global SA. We show that such variation modulates the function of a regulatory element of the developmentally relevant transcription factor HEY2 in human neural progenitor cells and is associated with structural changes in the inferior frontal cortex. These results indicate that non-coding genomic regions active during prenatal cortical development are involved in the evolution of human brain structure and identify novel regulatory elements and genes impacting modern human brain structure.},

As expected, magnetic resonance imaging is a major component of the project. Full brain images are obtained at every 6-month visit. A range of cognitive tests studying executive function and memory are employed less frequently. Two blood draws (baseline, 6 months) provide samples to measure concentrations of approximately 145 plasma biomarkers. In addition, other diagnostic measurements are performed including PET imaging, cerebral spinal fluid measurements of amyloid-beta and tau peptides, as well as genetic tests, demographics, and vital signs. ADNI data is available upon review of an application. There have been numerous reports of how various processes evolve during AD progression, including alterations in metabolic and neuroendocrine activity, cell survival, and cognitive behavior. Lacking an analytic model at the onset, we leveraged recent advances in machine learning, which allow us to deal with large, non-linear systems with many variables. Of particular note was examining how well binary predictions of future disease states could be learned from simple, non-invasive measurements like those dependent on blood samples. Such measurements make relatively little demands on the time and effort of medical staff or patient. We report findings with recall/precision/area under the receiver operator curve after application of CART, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, Our results show (i) Random Forests and Gradient Boosting work very well with such data, (ii) Prediction quality when applied to relatively easily obtained measurements (Cognitive scores, Genetic Risk and plasma biomarkers) achieve results that are competitive with magnetic resonance techniques. This is by no means an exhaustive study, but instead an exploration of the plausibility of defining a series of relatively inexpensive, broad population based tests.},

	doi = {10.1002/mds.26251},
	abstract = {Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is histopathologically characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The depletion of these neurons is thought to reduce the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway, as well as the neural fibers that link the substantia nigra to the striatum (putamen and caudate), causing a dysregulation in striatal activity that ultimately leads to lack of movement control. Based on diffusion tensor imaging, visualizing this pathway and measuring alterations of the fiber integrity remain challenging. The objectives were to 1) develop a diffusion tensor tractography protocol for reliably tracking the nigrostriatal fibers on multicenter data; 2) test whether the integrities measured by diffusion tensor imaging of the nigrostriatal fibers are abnormal in PD; and 3) test whether abnormal integrities of the nigrostriatal fibers in PD patients are associated with the severity of motor disability and putaminal dopamine binding ratios. Methods: Diffusion tensor tractography was performed on 50 drug-naïve PD patients and 27 healthy control subjects from the international multicenter Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative. Results: Tractography consistently detected the nigrostriatal fibers, yielding reliable diffusion measures. Fractional anisotropy, along with radial and axial diffusivity of the nigrostriatal tract, showed systematic abnormalities in patients. In addition, variations in fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity of the nigrostriatal tract were associated with the degree of motor deficits in PD patients. Conclusion: Taken together, the findings imply that the diffusion tensor imaging characteristic of the nigrostriatal tract is potentially an index for detecting and staging of early PD. © 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by a series of pathological mechanisms which contribute to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in structural diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in PD which has shed light on our understanding of structural abnormalities underlying PD symptoms or its associations with pathological mechanisms. One of the white matter tracts shown to be disrupted in PD with a possible contribution to some PD symptoms is the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). On the whole, lower ILF integrity contributes to thought disorders, impaired visual emotions, cognitive impairments such as semantic fluency deficits, and mood disorders. This review outlines the microstructural changes in ILF associated with systemic inflammation and various PD symptoms like cognitive decline, facial emotion recognition deficit, depression, color discrimination deficit, olfactory dysfunction, and tremor genesis. However, few studies have investigated DTI correlates of each symptom and larger studies with standardized imaging protocols are required to extend these preliminary findings and lead to more promising results.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to identify the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in measuring the regional distribution of abnormal microstructural progression in patients with Parkinson's disease who were enrolled in the Parkinson's progression marker initiative (PPMI). One hundred and twenty two de-novo PD patients (age = 60.5±9) and 50 healthy controls (age = 60.6±11) had DTI scans at baseline and 12.6±1 months later. Automated image processing included an intra-subject registration of all time points and an inter-subjects registration to a brain atlas. Annualized rates of DTI variations including fractional anisotropy (FA), radial (rD) and axial (aD) diffusivity were estimated in a total of 118 white matter and subcortical regions of interest. A mixed effects model framework was used to determine the degree to which DTI changes differed in PD relative to changes in healthy subjects. Significant DTI changes were also tested for correlations with changes in clinical measures, dopaminergic imaging and CSF biomarkers in PD patients. Compared to normal aging, PD was associated with higher rates of FA reduction, rD and aD increases predominantly in the substantia nigra, midbrain and thalamus. The highest rates of FA reduction involved the substantia nigra (3.6±1.4\%/year from baseline, whereas the highest rates of increased diffusivity involved the thalamus (rD: 8.0±2.9\%/year, aD: 4.0±1.5\%/year). In PD patients, high DTI changes in the substantia nigra correlated with increasing dopaminergic deficits as well as with declining alpha-synuclein and total tau protein concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. Increased DTI rates in the thalamus correlated with progressive decline in global cognition in PD. The results suggest that higher rates of regional microstructural degeneration are potential markers of PD progression.},

The purpose of the current study was to replicate recent methods that have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to compare individuals with PD with and without depression and to extend previous findings to allow for a better understanding of the results. Methods: Thirty-seven participants with de novo PD were retrieved from the Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) and were separated into a depressed PD group (dPD) or a non-depressed PD group (ndPD). Groups were determined based on scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-15). Initially, a replicated cut off score of ≥ 5 for dPD and {\textbackslash}textless5 for ndPD was applied. To better understand the results, we secondarily applied a more extreme group analysis with ≥ 9 for dPD and 0 for ndPD. White matter integrity between groups was compared between groups using tract-based spatial statistics. Results and Conclusion: The current study did not reveal significant differences in white matter microstructure between dPD and ndPD groups at the whole brain level or in specific regions of interest. The extreme group results were consistent. These findings did not replicate previous work that found reduced white matter integrity in limbic prefrontal regions in dPD relative to ndPD. The current study highlights the need for more replications of neuroimaging research.},

Patients were divided into two groups: (i) PD with dementia group (PDD) and (ii) PD without dementia group (PDND). There were 11 PDD and 26 PDND cases. Ten controls were also studied. Results - The PDD group showed significant FA reduction in the bilateral posterior cingulate bundles compared with PDND. FA values in the left posterior cingulate bundle showed significant correlations with many cognitive parameters. Interpretation - Our results showed that the posterior cingulate areas play some important roles in the dementing process in PDD.

Movement deficits and subtypes in PD subjects were assessed using the Motor Subscale (Part III) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Reduced fractional anisotropy (P {\textbackslash}textless .05, corrected) was found in PD subjects in regions related to the precentral gyrus, substantia nigra, putamen, posterior striatum, frontal lobe, and the supplementary motor areas. Reduced fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra correlated (P {\textbackslash}textless .05, corrected) with the increased rating scale motor scores.

	abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows measuring fractional anisotropy and similar microstructural indices of the brain white matter. Lower than normal fractional anisotropy as well as higher than normal diffusivity is associated with loss of microstructural integrity and neurodegeneration. Previous DTI studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have demonstrated abnormal fractional anisotropy in multiple white matter regions, particularly in the dopaminergic nuclei and dopaminergic pathways. However, DTI is not considered a diagnostic marker for the earliest Parkinson's disease since anisotropic alterations present a temporally divergent pattern during the earliest Parkinson's course. This article reviews a majority of clinically employed DTI studies in PD, and it aims to prove the utilities of DTI as a marker of diagnosing PD, correlating clinical symptomatology, tracking disease progression, and treatment effects. To address the challenge of DTI being a diagnostic marker for early PD, this article also provides a comparison of the results from a longitudinal, early stage, multicenter clinical cohort of Parkinson's research with previous publications. This review provides evidences of DTI as a promising marker for monitoring PD progression and classifying atypical PD types, and it also interprets the possible pathophysiologic processes under the complex pattern of fractional anisotropic changes in the first few years of PD. Recent technical advantages, limitations, and further research strategies of clinical DTI in PD are additionally discussed.},

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {Super resolution (SR) methods typically assume that the low-resolution (LR) image was downscaled from the unknown high-resolution (HR) image by a fixed 'ideal' downscaling kernel (e.g. Bicubic downscaling). However, this is rarely the case in real LR images, in contrast to synthetically generated SR datasets. When the assumed downscaling kernel deviates from the true one, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates. This gave rise to Blind-SR - namely, SR when the downscaling kernel (“SR-kernel”) is unknown. It was further shown that the true SR-kernel is the one that maximizes the recurrence of patches across scales of the LR image. In this paper we show how this powerful cross-scale recurrence property can be realized using Deep Internal Learning. We introduce “KernelGAN”, an image-specific Internal-GAN [29], which trains solely on the LR test image at test time, and learns its internal distribution of patches. Its Generator is trained to produce a downscaled version of the LR test image, such that its Discriminator cannot distinguish between the patch distribution of the downscaled image, and the patch distribution of the original LR image. The Generator, once trained, constitutes the downscaling operation with the correct image-specific SR-kernel. KernelGAN is fully unsupervised, requires no training data other than the input image itself, and leads to state-of-the-art results in Blind-SR when plugged into existing SR algorithms.},

	abstract = {Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy – Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) are often represented by similar clinical symptoms, which may challenge diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare regional cerebral diffusion properties in PD and PSP-RS subjects and evaluate the use of these metrics for an automatic classification framework.
Material and methods
Diffusion-tensor MRI datasets from 52 PD and 21 PSP-RS subjects were employed for this study. Using an atlas-based approach, regional median values of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were measured and employed for feature selection using RELIEFF and subsequent classification using a support vector machine.
Results
According to RELIEFF, the top 17 diffusion values consisting of deep gray matter structures, the brainstem, and frontal cortex were found to be especially informative for an automatic classification. A MANCOVA analysis performed on these diffusion values as dependent variables revealed that PSP-RS and PD subjects differ significantly (p {\textless} .001). Generally, PSP-RS subjects exhibit reduced FA, and increased MD, RD, and AD values in nearly all brain structures analyzed compared to PD subjects. The leave-one-out cross-validation of the support vector machine classifier revealed that the classifier can differentiate PD and PSP-RS subjects with an accuracy of 87.7\%. More precisely, six PD subjects were wrongly classified as PSP-RS and three PSP-RS subjects were wrongly classified as PD.
Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that PSP-RS subjects exhibit widespread and more severe diffusion alterations compared to PD patients, which appears valuable for an automatic computer-aided diagnosis approach.},

	abstract = {Non-manifesting carriers (NMCs) of Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related mutations such as LRRK2 and GBA are at an increased risk for developing PD. Dopamine transporter (DaT)-spectral positron emission computed tomography is widely used for capturing functional nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. However, it does not reflect other ongoing neuronal processes; especially in the prodromal stages of the disease. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been proposed as a mode for assessing functional alterations associated with PD, but its relation to dopaminergic deficiency remains unclear. We aimed to study the association between presynaptic striatal dopamine uptake and functional connectivity (FC) patterns among healthy first-degree relatives of PD patients with mutations in LRRK2 and GBA genes. N = 85 healthy first-degree subjects were enrolled and genotyped. All participants underwent DaT and rs-fMRI scans, as well as a comprehensive clinical assessment battery. Between-group differences in FC within striatal regions were investigated and compared with striatal binding ratios (SBR). N = 26 GBA-NMCs, N = 25 LRRK2-NMCs, and N = 34 age-matched nonmanifesting noncarriers (NM-NCs) were included in each study group based on genetic status. While genetically-defined groups were similar across clinical measures, LRRK2-NMCs demonstrated lower SBR in the right putamen compared with NM-NCs, and higher right putamen FC compared to GBA-NMCs. In this group, higher striatal FC was associated with increased risk for PD. The observed differential SBR and FC patterns among LRRK2-NMCs and GBA-NMCs indicate that DaTscan and FC assessments might offer a more sensitive prediction of the risk for PD in the pre-clinical stages of the disease.},

Abnormal forms of alpha-syn trigger selective and progressive neuronal death through mitochondrial impairment, lysosomal dysfunction, and alteration of calcium homeostasis not only in PD but also in other alpha-syn-related neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Furthermore, alpha-syn-dependent early synaptic and plastic alterations and the underlying mechanisms preceding overt neurodegeneration have attracted great interest. In particular, the presence of early inflammation in experimental models and PD patients, occurring before deposition and spreading of alpha-syn, suggests a mechanistic link between inflammation and synaptic dysfunction. The knowledge of these early mechanisms is of seminal importance to support the research on reliable biomarkers to precociously identify the disease and possible disease-modifying therapies targeting alpha-syn. In this review, we will discuss these critical issues, providing a state of the art of the role of this protein in early PD and other synucleinopathies.},

These findings suggest that alpha-synuclein aggregates that are associated with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy correspond to different conformational strains of alpha-synuclein, which can be amplified and detected by alpha-synuclein-PMCA. Our results may help to improve our understanding of the mechanism of alpha-synuclein misfolding and the structures of the aggregates that are implicated in different synucleinopathies, and may also enable the development of a biochemical assay to discriminate between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAAs) have the potential to differentiate people with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls. We used the well characterised, multicentre Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort to further assess the diagnostic performance of the alpha-synuclein SAA and to examine whether the assay identifies heterogeneity among patients and enables the early identification of at-risk groups.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis is based on assessments done at enrolment for PPMI participants (including people with sporadic Parkinson's disease from LRRK2 and GBA variants, healthy controls, prodromal individuals with either rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) or hyposmia, and non-manifesting carriers of LRRK2 and GBA variants) from 33 participating academic neurology outpatient practices worldwide (in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK, and the USA). alpha-synuclein SAA analysis of CSF was performed using previously described methods. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in participants with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, including subgroups based on genetic and clinical features. We established the frequency of positive alpha-synuclein SAA results in prodromal participants (RBD and hyposmia) and non-manifesting carriers of genetic variants associated with Parkinson's disease, and compared alpha-synuclein SAA to clinical measures and other biomarkers. We used odds ratio estimates with 95\% CIs to measure the association between alpha-synuclein SAA status and categorical measures, and two-sample 95\% CIs from the resampling method to assess differences in medians between alpha-synuclein SAA positive and negative participants for continuous measures. A linear regression model was used to control for potential confounders such as age and sex.
FINDINGS: This analysis included 1123 participants who were enrolled between July 7, 2010, and July 4, 2019. Of these, 545 had Parkinson's disease, 163 were healthy controls, 54 were participants with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit, 51 were prodromal participants, and 310 were non-manifesting carriers. Sensitivity for Parkinson's disease was 87·7\% (95\% CI 84·9-90·5), and specificity for healthy controls was 96·3\% (93·4-99·2). The sensitivity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in sporadic Parkinson's disease with the typical olfactory deficit was 98·6\% (96·4-99·4). The proportion of positive alpha-synuclein SAA was lower than this figure in subgroups including LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (67·5\% [59·2-75·8]) and participants with sporadic Parkinson's disease without olfactory deficit (78·3\% [69·8-86·7]). Participants with LRRK2 variant and normal olfaction had an even lower alpha-synuclein SAA positivity rate (34·7\% [21·4-48·0]). Among prodromal and at-risk groups, 44 (86\%) of 51 of participants with RBD or hyposmia had positive alpha-synuclein SAA (16 of 18 with hyposmia, and 28 of 33 with RBD). 25 (8\%) of 310 non-manifesting carriers (14 of 159 [9\%] LRRK2 and 11 of 151 [7\%] GBA) were positive.
INTERPRETATION: This study represents the largest analysis so far of the alpha-synuclein SAA for the biochemical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Our results show that the assay classifies people with Parkinson's disease with high sensitivity and specificity, provides information about molecular heterogeneity, and detects prodromal individuals before diagnosis. These findings suggest a crucial role for the alpha-synuclein SAA in therapeutic development, both to identify pathologically defined subgroups of people with Parkinson's disease and to establish biomarker-defined at-risk cohorts.

Moreover, we showed that indexes derived from resting-state fMRI alone could discriminate between PD and HC, while mean diffusivity in the cerebellum and the putamen alone could discriminate between MSA and HC. On the other hand, a more diverse set of indexes derived by multiple modalities was needed to discriminate between the two disorders.

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease varies in severity and age of onset. One source of this variability is sex. Males are twice as likely as females to develop Parkinson’s disease, and tend to have more severe symptoms and greater speed of progression. However, to date, there is little information in large cohorts on sex differences in the patterns of neurodegeneration. Here we used MRI and clinical information from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative to measure structural brain differences between sexes in Parkinson’s disease after regressing out the expected effect of age and sex. We derived atrophy maps from deformation-based morphometry of T1-weighted MRI and connectivity from diffusion-weighted MRI in de novo Parkinson’s disease patients (149 males: 83 females) with comparable clinical severity, and healthy control participants (78 males: 39 females). Overall, even though the two patient groups were matched for disease duration and severity, males demonstrated generally greater brain atrophy and disrupted connectivity. Males with Parkinson’s disease had significantly greater tissue loss than females in 11 cortical regions including bilateral frontal and left insular lobe, right postcentral gyrus, left inferior temporal and cingulate gyrus and left thalamus, while females had greater atrophy in six cortical regions, including regions in the left frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, left insular gyrus and right occipital cortex. Local efficiency of white matter connectivity showed greater disruption in males in multiple regions such as basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. These findings support the idea that development of Parkinson’s disease may involve different pathological mechanisms and yield distinct prognosis in males and females, which may have implications for research into neuroprotection, and stratification for clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Individuals with Parkinson’s disease present with a complex clinical phenotype, encompassing sleep, motor, cognitive, and affective disturbances. However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the “average” patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method—similarity network fusion—to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson’s disease from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from the fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.},

The PTBP uses cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI to quantify cortex, white matter, resting state functional connectivity and brain perfusion, as measured by Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), in 120 children 7–18 years of age. We describe the PTBP and show, as a demonstration of validity, that global summary measurements capture the trajectories that demarcate critical turning points in brain maturation.

	abstract = {Combat military and civilian law enforcement personnel may be exposed to repetitive low-intensity blast events during training and operations. Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as “breachers” or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

	abstract = {The Advanced Normalizations Tools ecosystem, known as ANTsX, consists of multiple open-source software libraries which house top-performing algorithms used worldwide by scientific and research communities for processing and analyzing biological and medical imaging data. The base software library, ANTs, is built upon, and contributes to, the NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit. Founded in 2008 with the highly regarded Symmetric Normalization image registration framework, the ANTs library has since grown to include additional functionality. Recent enhancements include statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network architectures and trained models for specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These pipelines significantly improve computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs workflows and simultaneously illustrate the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework for medical image analysis.},

However, a better appreciation of the limitations of small sample studies has led to an increased number of multi-site, multi-scanner protocols to understand human brain function. As part of a multi-site project examining social cognition in schizophrenia, a group of “travelling human phantoms” had structural T1, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRIs obtained annually at each of three sites. Scan protocols were carefully harmonized across sites prior to the study. Due to scanner upgrades at each site (all sites acquired PRISMA MRIs during the study) and one participant being replaced, the end result was 30 MRI scans across 4 people, 6 MRIs, and 4 years. This dataset includes multiple neuroimaging modalities and repeated scans across six MRIs. It can be used to evaluate differences across scanners, consistency of pipeline outputs, or test multi-scanner harmonization approaches.},

	abstract = {Depigmentation of the substantia nigra is a conspicuous pathological feature of Parkinson's disease and related to a loss of neuromelanin. Similar to melanin, neuromelanin has paramagnetic properties resulting in signal increase on specific T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was to assess signal changes in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease using an optimized neuromelanin-sensitive T1 scan. Ten patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 matched controls underwent high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with magnetization transfer effect at 3T. The size and signal intensity of the substantia nigra pars compacta were determined as the number of pixels with signal intensity higher than background signal intensity + 3 standard deviations and regional contrast ratio. Patients were subclassified as early stage (n = 6) and late stage (n = 4) using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr Parkinson's disease staging scale. The T1 hyperintense area in the substantia nigra was substantially smaller in patients compared with controls (−60\%, P {\textless} .01), and contrast was reduced (−3\%, P {\textless} .05). Size reduction was even more pronounced in more advanced disease (−78\%) than in early-stage disease (−47\%). We present preliminary findings using a modified T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging technique showing stage-dependent substantia nigra signal reduction in Parkinson's disease as a putative marker of neuromelanin loss. Our data suggest that reduction in the size of neuromelanin-rich substantia nigra correlates well with postmortem observations of dopaminergic neuron loss. Further validation of our results could potentially lead to development of a new biomarker of disease progression in Parkinson's disease. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

Relative SN area, MD, FA and R2* were measured in ROIs traced on SN. Correlation with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores was assessed. In LPD, the SN area was significantly reduced with respect to EPD (p = 0.04) and control subjects (p {\textless} 0.001). In EPD, the SN area was also significantly smaller than in controls (p = 0.006). Similarly, the SN volume significantly differed between LPD and controls (p = 0.001) and between EPD and LPD (p = 0.049), while no significant differences were found between controls and EPD. Both SN area (r = 0.47, p = 0.004) and volume (r = 0.46, p = 0.005) correlated with UPDRS scores. At 1.5 T, SN morphological measurements were sensitive to early PD changes and able to track the disease progression, while MD and FA measures and relaxometry did not provide significant results.},

	abstract = {One objective of modern neuroimaging is to identify markers that can aid in diagnosis, disease progression monitoring and long-term drug impact analysis. In this study, Parkinson-associated physiopathological modifications were characterized in six subcortical structures by simultaneously measuring quantitative magnetic resonance parameters sensitive to complementary tissue characteristics (i.e. volume atrophy, iron deposition and microstructural damage). Thirty patients with Parkinson’s disease and 22 control subjects underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging with T2*-weighted, whole-brain T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. The mean R2* value, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy in the pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, substantia nigra and red nucleus were compared between patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects. Comparisons were also performed using voxel-based analysis of R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps to determine which subregion of the basal ganglia showed the greater difference for each parameter. Averages of each subregion were then used in a logistic regression analysis. Compared with control subjects, patients with Parkinson’s disease displayed significantly higher R2* values in the substantia nigra, lower fractional anisotropy values in the substantia nigra and thalamus, and higher mean diffusivity values in the thalamus. Voxel-based analyses confirmed these results and, in addition, showed a significant difference in the mean diffusivity in the striatum. The combination of three markers was sufficient to obtain a 95\% global accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for discriminating patients with Parkinson’s disease from controls. The markers comprising discriminating combinations were R2* in the substantia nigra, fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra and mean diffusivity in the putamen or caudate nucleus. Remarkably, the predictive markers involved the nigrostriatal structures that characterize Parkinson’s physiopathology. Furthermore, highly discriminating combinations included markers from three different magnetic resonance parameters (R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy). These findings demonstrate that multimodal magnetic resonance imaging of subcortical grey matter structures is useful for the evaluation of Parkinson’s disease and, possibly, of other subcortical pathologies.},

LRRK2 mutations, and particularly the most common mutation Gly2019Ser, are observed in patients with autosomal dominant PD and in those with apparent sporadic PD, who are clinically indistinguishable from those with idiopathic PD. The discoveries that pathogenic mutations in the LRRK2 gene increase LRRK2 kinase activity and that small-molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors can be neuroprotective in preclinical models of PD have placed LRRK2 at the centre of disease modification efforts in PD. Recent investigations also suggest that LRRK2 has a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD and that LRRK2 therapies might, therefore, be beneficial in this common subtype of PD. In this Review, we describe the characteristics of LRRK2-associated PD that are most relevant to the development of LRRK2-targeted therapies and the design and implementation of clinical trials. We highlight strategies for correcting the effects of mutations in the LRRK2 gene, focusing on how to identify which patients are the optimal candidates and how to decide on the timing of such trials. In addition, we discuss challenges in implementing trials of disease-modifying treatment in people who carry LRRK2 mutations.},

	abstract = {Classical accounts of the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease have emphasized degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with consequent dysfunction of cortico–striatal–thalamic loops. In contrast, post-mortem studies indicate that pathological changes in Parkinson’s disease (Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. The nigrostriatal and histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they do emphasize different anatomical structures. To address the question of which brain structures are functionally most affected by Parkinson’s disease, we performed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study focused on striatal functional connectivity. We contrasted 13 patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease versus 19 age-matched control subjects, using methodology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of head motion during scanning. The principal finding in the Parkinson’s disease group was markedly lower striatal correlations with thalamus, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. This result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease. Focally altered functional connectivity also was observed in sensori-motor and visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. Striatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was graded (posterior putamen \&gt; anterior putamen \&gt; caudate), in both patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects, in a manner that corresponds to well-documented gradient of striatal dopaminergic function loss in Parkinson’s disease. We hypothesize that this gradient provides a clue to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.},

	abstract = {See Nieuwhof and Helmich (doi:10.1093/brain/awx267) for a scientific commentary on this article.Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Previous studies measuring spontaneous brain activity using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging have reported abnormal changes in broadly distributed whole-brain networks. Although resting state functional connectivity, estimating temporal correlations between brain regions, is measured with the assumption that intrinsic fluctuations throughout the scan are stable, dynamic changes of functional connectivity have recently been suggested to reflect aspects of functional capacity of neural systems, and thus may serve as biomarkers of disease. The present work is the first study to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity in patients with Parkinson’s disease, with a focus on the temporal properties of functional connectivity states as well as the variability of network topological organization using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-one Parkinson’s disease patients and 23 healthy controls were studied using group spatial independent component analysis, a sliding windows approach, and graph-theory methods. The dynamic functional connectivity analyses suggested two discrete connectivity configurations: a more frequent, sparsely connected within-network state (State I) and a less frequent, more strongly interconnected between-network state (State II). In patients with Parkinson’s disease, the occurrence of the sparsely connected State I dropped by 12.62\%, while the expression of the more strongly interconnected State II increased by the same amount. This was consistent with the altered temporal properties of the dynamic functional connectivity characterized by a shortening of the dwell time of State I and by a proportional increase of the dwell time pattern in State II. These changes are suggestive of a reduction in functional segregation among networks and are correlated with the clinical severity of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Additionally, there was a higher variability in the network global efficiency, suggesting an abnormal global integration of the brain networks. The altered functional segregation and abnormal global integration in brain networks confirmed the vulnerability of functional connectivity networks in Parkinson’s disease.},

Strengths of the UPDRS include its wide utilization, its application across the clinical spectrum of PD, its nearly comprehensive coverage of motor symptoms, and its clinimetric properties, including reliability and validity. Weaknesses include several ambiguities in the written text, inadequate instructions for raters, some metric flaws, and the absence of screening questions on several important non-motor aspects of PD. The Task Force recommends that the MDS sponsor the development of a new version of the UPDRS and encourage efforts to establish its clinimetric properties, especially addressing the need to define a Minimal Clinically Relevant Difference and a Minimal Clinically Relevant Incremental Difference, as well as testing its correlation with the current UPDRS. If developed, the new scale should be culturally unbiased and be tested in different racial, gender, and age-groups. Future goals should include the definition of UPDRS scores with confidence intervals that correlate with clinically pertinent designations, “minimal,” “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” PD. Whereas the presence of non-motor components of PD can be identified with screening questions, a new version of the UPDRS should include an official appendix that includes other, more detailed, and optionally used scales to determine severity of these impairments. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society},

	abstract = {Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy – Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) are often represented by similar clinical symptoms, which may challenge diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare regional cerebral diffusion properties in PD and PSP-RS subjects and evaluate the use of these metrics for an automatic classification framework.
Material and methods
Diffusion-tensor MRI datasets from 52 PD and 21 PSP-RS subjects were employed for this study. Using an atlas-based approach, regional median values of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were measured and employed for feature selection using RELIEFF and subsequent classification using a support vector machine.
Results
According to RELIEFF, the top 17 diffusion values consisting of deep gray matter structures, the brainstem, and frontal cortex were found to be especially informative for an automatic classification. A MANCOVA analysis performed on these diffusion values as dependent variables revealed that PSP-RS and PD subjects differ significantly (p {\textless} .001). Generally, PSP-RS subjects exhibit reduced FA, and increased MD, RD, and AD values in nearly all brain structures analyzed compared to PD subjects. The leave-one-out cross-validation of the support vector machine classifier revealed that the classifier can differentiate PD and PSP-RS subjects with an accuracy of 87.7\%. More precisely, six PD subjects were wrongly classified as PSP-RS and three PSP-RS subjects were wrongly classified as PD.
Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that PSP-RS subjects exhibit widespread and more severe diffusion alterations compared to PD patients, which appears valuable for an automatic computer-aided diagnosis approach.},

	abstract = {Although the discovery of the critical role of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is now twenty-five years old, it still represents a milestone in PD research. Abnormal forms of alpha-syn trigger selective and progressive neuronal death through mitochondrial impairment, lysosomal dysfunction, and alteration of calcium homeostasis not only in PD but also in other alpha-syn-related neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Furthermore, alpha-syn-dependent early synaptic and plastic alterations and the underlying mechanisms preceding overt neurodegeneration have attracted great interest. In particular, the presence of early inflammation in experimental models and PD patients, occurring before deposition and spreading of alpha-syn, suggests a mechanistic link between inflammation and synaptic dysfunction. The knowledge of these early mechanisms is of seminal importance to support the research on reliable biomarkers to precociously identify the disease and possible disease-modifying therapies targeting alpha-syn. In this review, we will discuss these critical issues, providing a state of the art of the role of this protein in early PD and other synucleinopathies.},

	abstract = {Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy1. Clinically, it is challenging to differentiate Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, especially at the early stages of disease2. Aggregates of alpha-synuclein in distinct synucleinopathies have been proposed to represent different conformational strains of alpha-synuclein that can self-propagate and spread from cell to cell3-6. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is a technique that has previously been used to detect alpha-synuclein aggregates in samples of cerebrospinal fluid with high sensitivity and specificity7,8. Here we show that the alpha-synuclein-PMCA assay can discriminate between samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and samples from patients with multiple system atrophy, with an overall sensitivity of 95.4\%. We used a combination of biochemical, biophysical and biological methods to analyse the product of alpha-synuclein-PMCA, and found that the characteristics of the alpha-synuclein aggregates in the cerebrospinal fluid could be used to readily distinguish between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. We also found that the properties of aggregates that were amplified from the cerebrospinal fluid were similar to those of aggregates that were amplified from the brain. These findings suggest that alpha-synuclein aggregates that are associated with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy correspond to different conformational strains of alpha-synuclein, which can be amplified and detected by alpha-synuclein-PMCA. Our results may help to improve our understanding of the mechanism of alpha-synuclein misfolding and the structures of the aggregates that are implicated in different synucleinopathies, and may also enable the development of a biochemical assay to discriminate between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAAs) have the potential to differentiate people with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls. We used the well characterised, multicentre Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort to further assess the diagnostic performance of the alpha-synuclein SAA and to examine whether the assay identifies heterogeneity among patients and enables the early identification of at-risk groups.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis is based on assessments done at enrolment for PPMI participants (including people with sporadic Parkinson's disease from LRRK2 and GBA variants, healthy controls, prodromal individuals with either rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) or hyposmia, and non-manifesting carriers of LRRK2 and GBA variants) from 33 participating academic neurology outpatient practices worldwide (in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK, and the USA). alpha-synuclein SAA analysis of CSF was performed using previously described methods. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in participants with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, including subgroups based on genetic and clinical features. We established the frequency of positive alpha-synuclein SAA results in prodromal participants (RBD and hyposmia) and non-manifesting carriers of genetic variants associated with Parkinson's disease, and compared alpha-synuclein SAA to clinical measures and other biomarkers. We used odds ratio estimates with 95\% CIs to measure the association between alpha-synuclein SAA status and categorical measures, and two-sample 95\% CIs from the resampling method to assess differences in medians between alpha-synuclein SAA positive and negative participants for continuous measures. A linear regression model was used to control for potential confounders such as age and sex.
FINDINGS: This analysis included 1123 participants who were enrolled between July 7, 2010, and July 4, 2019. Of these, 545 had Parkinson's disease, 163 were healthy controls, 54 were participants with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit, 51 were prodromal participants, and 310 were non-manifesting carriers. Sensitivity for Parkinson's disease was 87·7\% (95\% CI 84·9-90·5), and specificity for healthy controls was 96·3\% (93·4-99·2). The sensitivity of the alpha-synuclein SAA in sporadic Parkinson's disease with the typical olfactory deficit was 98·6\% (96·4-99·4). The proportion of positive alpha-synuclein SAA was lower than this figure in subgroups including LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (67·5\% [59·2-75·8]) and participants with sporadic Parkinson's disease without olfactory deficit (78·3\% [69·8-86·7]). Participants with LRRK2 variant and normal olfaction had an even lower alpha-synuclein SAA positivity rate (34·7\% [21·4-48·0]). Among prodromal and at-risk groups, 44 (86\%) of 51 of participants with RBD or hyposmia had positive alpha-synuclein SAA (16 of 18 with hyposmia, and 28 of 33 with RBD). 25 (8\%) of 310 non-manifesting carriers (14 of 159 [9\%] LRRK2 and 11 of 151 [7\%] GBA) were positive.
INTERPRETATION: This study represents the largest analysis so far of the alpha-synuclein SAA for the biochemical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Our results show that the assay classifies people with Parkinson's disease with high sensitivity and specificity, provides information about molecular heterogeneity, and detects prodromal individuals before diagnosis. These findings suggest a crucial role for the alpha-synuclein SAA in therapeutic development, both to identify pathologically defined subgroups of people with Parkinson's disease and to establish biomarker-defined at-risk cohorts.

	abstract = {Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) are two parkinsonian syndromes that share many symptoms, albeit having very different prognosis. Although previous studies have proposed multimodal MRI protocols combined with multivariate analysis to discriminate between these two populations and healthy controls, studies combining all MRI indexes relevant for these disorders (i.e. grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, iron deposition, brain activity at rest and brain connectivity) with a completely data-driven voxelwise analysis for discrimination are still lacking. In this study, we used such a complete MRI protocol and adapted a fully-data driven analysis pipeline to discriminate between these populations and a healthy controls (HC) group. The pipeline combined several feature selection and reduction steps to obtain interpretable models with a low number of discriminant features that can shed light onto the brain pathology of PD and MSA. Using this pipeline, we could discriminate between PD and HC (best accuracy = 0.78), MSA and HC (best accuracy = 0.94) and PD and MSA (best accuracy = 0.88). Moreover, we showed that indexes derived from resting-state fMRI alone could discriminate between PD and HC, while mean diffusivity in the cerebellum and the putamen alone could discriminate between MSA and HC. On the other hand, a more diverse set of indexes derived by multiple modalities was needed to discriminate between the two disorders. We showed that our pipeline was able to discriminate between distinct pathological populations while delivering sparse model that could be used to better understand the neural underpinning of the pathologies.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease varies in severity and age of onset. One source of this variability is sex. Males are twice as likely as females to develop Parkinson’s disease, and tend to have more severe symptoms and greater speed of progression. However, to date, there is little information in large cohorts on sex differences in the patterns of neurodegeneration. Here we used MRI and clinical information from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative to measure structural brain differences between sexes in Parkinson’s disease after regressing out the expected effect of age and sex. We derived atrophy maps from deformation-based morphometry of T1-weighted MRI and connectivity from diffusion-weighted MRI in de novo Parkinson’s disease patients (149 males: 83 females) with comparable clinical severity, and healthy control participants (78 males: 39 females). Overall, even though the two patient groups were matched for disease duration and severity, males demonstrated generally greater brain atrophy and disrupted connectivity. Males with Parkinson’s disease had significantly greater tissue loss than females in 11 cortical regions including bilateral frontal and left insular lobe, right postcentral gyrus, left inferior temporal and cingulate gyrus and left thalamus, while females had greater atrophy in six cortical regions, including regions in the left frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, left insular gyrus and right occipital cortex. Local efficiency of white matter connectivity showed greater disruption in males in multiple regions such as basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. These findings support the idea that development of Parkinson’s disease may involve different pathological mechanisms and yield distinct prognosis in males and females, which may have implications for research into neuroprotection, and stratification for clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Individuals with Parkinson’s disease present with a complex clinical phenotype, encompassing sleep, motor, cognitive, and affective disturbances. However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the “average” patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method—similarity network fusion—to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson’s disease from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from the fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.},

Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as “breachers” or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility of multicenter diffusion magnetic resonance imaging has drawn more attention recently due to rapidly increasing need for large-size brain imaging studies. Advanced multi-shell diffusion models are recommended for their potentials to provide variety of physio-pathological information. While previous studies have investigated the consistency of single-shell diffusion acquisition from various hardware and protocols, a well-controlled study with multi-shell acquisition would be necessary to understand the inherent factors of reproducibility from new complexity of such acquisition protocol. In this study, three traveling subjects were scanned at eight imaging centers equipped with the same type of scanners using the same multi-shell diffusion imaging protocol. Track density imaging and structure connectomes were investigated in local-scale distribution and in distal-scale connectivity, respectively. With evaluations of the coefficient of variation and the intra-class correlation coefficient, our results indicated: 1) similar to single-shell schemes, the intra-center reproducibility of multi-shell is higher than inter-center; 2) multi-shell schemes produce higher reproducibility and precision among centers compared to the single-shell schemes; and 3) in addition to the diffusion schemes, image quality and the presence of complex fiber structure could also associated with multicenter reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Depigmentation of the substantia nigra is a conspicuous pathological feature of Parkinson's disease and related to a loss of neuromelanin. Similar to melanin, neuromelanin has paramagnetic properties resulting in signal increase on specific T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was to assess signal changes in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease using an optimized neuromelanin-sensitive T1 scan. Ten patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 matched controls underwent high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with magnetization transfer effect at 3T. The size and signal intensity of the substantia nigra pars compacta were determined as the number of pixels with signal intensity higher than background signal intensity + 3 standard deviations and regional contrast ratio. Patients were subclassified as early stage (n = 6) and late stage (n = 4) using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr Parkinson's disease staging scale. The T1 hyperintense area in the substantia nigra was substantially smaller in patients compared with controls (−60\%, P {\textless} .01), and contrast was reduced (−3\%, P {\textless} .05). Size reduction was even more pronounced in more advanced disease (−78\%) than in early-stage disease (−47\%). We present preliminary findings using a modified T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging technique showing stage-dependent substantia nigra signal reduction in Parkinson's disease as a putative marker of neuromelanin loss. Our data suggest that reduction in the size of neuromelanin-rich substantia nigra correlates well with postmortem observations of dopaminergic neuron loss. Further validation of our results could potentially lead to development of a new biomarker of disease progression in Parkinson's disease. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

Twenty-two early PD (EPD), 20 late PD (LPD) and 20 healthy subjects (age 64.7 ± 4.9, 60.5 ± 6.1, and 61 ± 7.2 years, respectively) underwent 1.5 T MR imaging with double-TI-IR T1-weighted, T2*-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. Relative SN area, MD, FA and R2* were measured in ROIs traced on SN. Correlation with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores was assessed. In LPD, the SN area was significantly reduced with respect to EPD (p = 0.04) and control subjects (p {\textless} 0.001). In EPD, the SN area was also significantly smaller than in controls (p = 0.006). Similarly, the SN volume significantly differed between LPD and controls (p = 0.001) and between EPD and LPD (p = 0.049), while no significant differences were found between controls and EPD. Both SN area (r = 0.47, p = 0.004) and volume (r = 0.46, p = 0.005) correlated with UPDRS scores. At 1.5 T, SN morphological measurements were sensitive to early PD changes and able to track the disease progression, while MD and FA measures and relaxometry did not provide significant results.},

	abstract = {One objective of modern neuroimaging is to identify markers that can aid in diagnosis, disease progression monitoring and long-term drug impact analysis. In this study, Parkinson-associated physiopathological modifications were characterized in six subcortical structures by simultaneously measuring quantitative magnetic resonance parameters sensitive to complementary tissue characteristics (i.e. volume atrophy, iron deposition and microstructural damage). Thirty patients with Parkinson’s disease and 22 control subjects underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging with T2*-weighted, whole-brain T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. The mean R2* value, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy in the pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, substantia nigra and red nucleus were compared between patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects. Comparisons were also performed using voxel-based analysis of R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps to determine which subregion of the basal ganglia showed the greater difference for each parameter. Averages of each subregion were then used in a logistic regression analysis. Compared with control subjects, patients with Parkinson’s disease displayed significantly higher R2* values in the substantia nigra, lower fractional anisotropy values in the substantia nigra and thalamus, and higher mean diffusivity values in the thalamus. Voxel-based analyses confirmed these results and, in addition, showed a significant difference in the mean diffusivity in the striatum. The combination of three markers was sufficient to obtain a 95\% global accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for discriminating patients with Parkinson’s disease from controls. The markers comprising discriminating combinations were R2* in the substantia nigra, fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra and mean diffusivity in the putamen or caudate nucleus. Remarkably, the predictive markers involved the nigrostriatal structures that characterize Parkinson’s physiopathology. Furthermore, highly discriminating combinations included markers from three different magnetic resonance parameters (R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy). These findings demonstrate that multimodal magnetic resonance imaging of subcortical grey matter structures is useful for the evaluation of Parkinson’s disease and, possibly, of other subcortical pathologies.},

LRRK2 mutations, and particularly the most common mutation Gly2019Ser, are observed in patients with autosomal dominant PD and in those with apparent sporadic PD, who are clinically indistinguishable from those with idiopathic PD. The discoveries that pathogenic mutations in the LRRK2 gene increase LRRK2 kinase activity and that small-molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors can be neuroprotective in preclinical models of PD have placed LRRK2 at the centre of disease modification efforts in PD. Recent investigations also suggest that LRRK2 has a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD and that LRRK2 therapies might, therefore, be beneficial in this common subtype of PD. In this Review, we describe the characteristics of LRRK2-associated PD that are most relevant to the development of LRRK2-targeted therapies and the design and implementation of clinical trials. We highlight strategies for correcting the effects of mutations in the LRRK2 gene, focusing on how to identify which patients are the optimal candidates and how to decide on the timing of such trials. In addition, we discuss challenges in implementing trials of disease-modifying treatment in people who carry LRRK2 mutations.},

	abstract = {Classical accounts of the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease have emphasized degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with consequent dysfunction of cortico–striatal–thalamic loops. In contrast, post-mortem studies indicate that pathological changes in Parkinson’s disease (Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. The nigrostriatal and histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they do emphasize different anatomical structures. To address the question of which brain structures are functionally most affected by Parkinson’s disease, we performed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study focused on striatal functional connectivity. We contrasted 13 patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease versus 19 age-matched control subjects, using methodology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of head motion during scanning. The principal finding in the Parkinson’s disease group was markedly lower striatal correlations with thalamus, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. This result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease. Focally altered functional connectivity also was observed in sensori-motor and visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. Striatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was graded (posterior putamen \&gt; anterior putamen \&gt; caudate), in both patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects, in a manner that corresponds to well-documented gradient of striatal dopaminergic function loss in Parkinson’s disease. We hypothesize that this gradient provides a clue to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease.},

	abstract = {See Nieuwhof and Helmich (doi:10.1093/brain/awx267) for a scientific commentary on this article.Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Previous studies measuring spontaneous brain activity using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging have reported abnormal changes in broadly distributed whole-brain networks. Although resting state functional connectivity, estimating temporal correlations between brain regions, is measured with the assumption that intrinsic fluctuations throughout the scan are stable, dynamic changes of functional connectivity have recently been suggested to reflect aspects of functional capacity of neural systems, and thus may serve as biomarkers of disease. The present work is the first study to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity in patients with Parkinson’s disease, with a focus on the temporal properties of functional connectivity states as well as the variability of network topological organization using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-one Parkinson’s disease patients and 23 healthy controls were studied using group spatial independent component analysis, a sliding windows approach, and graph-theory methods. The dynamic functional connectivity analyses suggested two discrete connectivity configurations: a more frequent, sparsely connected within-network state (State I) and a less frequent, more strongly interconnected between-network state (State II). In patients with Parkinson’s disease, the occurrence of the sparsely connected State I dropped by 12.62\%, while the expression of the more strongly interconnected State II increased by the same amount. This was consistent with the altered temporal properties of the dynamic functional connectivity characterized by a shortening of the dwell time of State I and by a proportional increase of the dwell time pattern in State II. These changes are suggestive of a reduction in functional segregation among networks and are correlated with the clinical severity of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Additionally, there was a higher variability in the network global efficiency, suggesting an abnormal global integration of the brain networks. The altered functional segregation and abnormal global integration in brain networks confirmed the vulnerability of functional connectivity networks in Parkinson’s disease.},

For accurate differential diagnosis and for disease monitoring the availability of a sensitive and non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease would be essential. Although there has been notable progress in studying correlates of nigral degeneration by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the past decade, MRI and analysis techniques that allow accurate high-resolution mapping of the SN within a clinically acceptable acquisition time are still elusive. The main purpose of the preliminary study was to evaluate the potential role of the driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) method for delineation of the SN and differentiation of PD patients from healthy control subjects (n=10 in each group). We also investigated whether additional measures that can be obtained with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can further improve the MRI-guided discrimination between PD patients and controls. Our results show that the DESPOT1 method allows for a clear visualisation of the SN as a whole. Volumetric comparisons between ten PD patients and ten healthy subjects revealed significantly smaller volumes in patients for both the left and the right sides when the whole SN was considered. Combining SN volumetry and its connectivity with the thalamus improved the classification sensitivity to 100\% and specificity to 80\% for PD (discriminant function analysis with leave-one-out cross validation). Combining DESPOT1 imaging and DTI could therefore serve as a diagnostic marker for idiopathic Parkinson's disease in the future.},

Strengths of the UPDRS include its wide utilization, its application across the clinical spectrum of PD, its nearly comprehensive coverage of motor symptoms, and its clinimetric properties, including reliability and validity. Weaknesses include several ambiguities in the written text, inadequate instructions for raters, some metric flaws, and the absence of screening questions on several important non-motor aspects of PD. The Task Force recommends that the MDS sponsor the development of a new version of the UPDRS and encourage efforts to establish its clinimetric properties, especially addressing the need to define a Minimal Clinically Relevant Difference and a Minimal Clinically Relevant Incremental Difference, as well as testing its correlation with the current UPDRS. If developed, the new scale should be culturally unbiased and be tested in different racial, gender, and age-groups. Future goals should include the definition of UPDRS scores with confidence intervals that correlate with clinically pertinent designations, “minimal,” “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” PD. Whereas the presence of non-motor components of PD can be identified with screening questions, a new version of the UPDRS should include an official appendix that includes other, more detailed, and optionally used scales to determine severity of these impairments. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society},

	abstract = {Images of DaTscan (ioflupane [123I] SPECT) have been used as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis to facilitate the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative (ND) Parkinsonian Syndrome (PS) vs. non-dopamine deficiency aetiologies of Parkinsonism. Despite several systematic reviews having summarised the evidence on diagnostic accuracy, the impact of imaging results on clinical utility has not been systematically assessed. Our objective was to examine the available evidence on the clinical utility of DaTscan imaging in changing diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with suspected PS. We performed a systematic review of published studies of clinical utility from 2000 to 2019 without language restrictions. A meta-analysis of change in diagnosis and management rates reported from each study was performed using a random-effects model and logit transformation. Sub-group analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was performed to explore heterogeneity. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen of these contributed to the meta-analyses including 950 and 779 patients with a reported change in management and change in diagnosis, respectively. The use of DaTscan imaging resulted in a change in management in 54\% (95\% CI: 47–61\%) of patients. Change in diagnosis occurred in 31\% (95\% CI: 22–42\%) of patients. The two pooled analyses were characterised by high levels of heterogeneity. Our systematic review and meta-analysis show that imaging with DaTscan was associated with a change in management in approximately half the patients tested and the diagnosis was modified in one third. Regardless of time from symptom onset to scan results, these changes were consistent. Further research focusing on specific patient subgroups could provide additional evidence on the impact on clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Non-manifesting carriers (NMCs) of Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related mutations such as LRRK2 and GBA are at an increased risk for developing PD. Dopamine transporter (DaT)-spectral positron emission computed tomography is widely used for capturing functional nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. However, it does not reflect other ongoing neuronal processes; especially in the prodromal stages of the disease. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been proposed as a mode for assessing functional alterations associated with PD, but its relation to dopaminergic deficiency remains unclear. We aimed to study the association between presynaptic striatal dopamine uptake and functional connectivity (FC) patterns among healthy first-degree relatives of PD patients with mutations in LRRK2 and GBA genes. N = 85 healthy first-degree subjects were enrolled and genotyped. All participants underwent DaT and rs-fMRI scans, as well as a comprehensive clinical assessment battery. Between-group differences in FC within striatal regions were investigated and compared with striatal binding ratios (SBR). N = 26 GBA-NMCs, N = 25 LRRK2-NMCs, and N = 34 age-matched nonmanifesting noncarriers (NM-NCs) were included in each study group based on genetic status. While genetically-defined groups were similar across clinical measures, LRRK2-NMCs demonstrated lower SBR in the right putamen compared with NM-NCs, and higher right putamen FC compared to GBA-NMCs. In this group, higher striatal FC was associated with increased risk for PD. The observed differential SBR and FC patterns among LRRK2-NMCs and GBA-NMCs indicate that DaTscan and FC assessments might offer a more sensitive prediction of the risk for PD in the pre-clinical stages of the disease.},

	abstract = {Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in five countries and three continents, which is still growing.},

	abstract = {Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy – Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) are often represented by similar clinical symptoms, which may challenge diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare regional cerebral diffusion properties in PD and PSP-RS subjects and evaluate the use of these metrics for an automatic classification framework.
Material and methods
Diffusion-tensor MRI datasets from 52 PD and 21 PSP-RS subjects were employed for this study. Using an atlas-based approach, regional median values of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were measured and employed for feature selection using RELIEFF and subsequent classification using a support vector machine.
Results
According to RELIEFF, the top 17 diffusion values consisting of deep gray matter structures, the brainstem, and frontal cortex were found to be especially informative for an automatic classification. A MANCOVA analysis performed on these diffusion values as dependent variables revealed that PSP-RS and PD subjects differ significantly (p {\textless} .001). Generally, PSP-RS subjects exhibit reduced FA, and increased MD, RD, and AD values in nearly all brain structures analyzed compared to PD subjects. The leave-one-out cross-validation of the support vector machine classifier revealed that the classifier can differentiate PD and PSP-RS subjects with an accuracy of 87.7\%. More precisely, six PD subjects were wrongly classified as PSP-RS and three PSP-RS subjects were wrongly classified as PD.
Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that PSP-RS subjects exhibit widespread and more severe diffusion alterations compared to PD patients, which appears valuable for an automatic computer-aided diagnosis approach.},

	abstract = {Context An existing major challenge in Parkinson’s disease (PD) research is the identification of biomarkers of disease progression. While magnetic resonance imaging is a potential source of PD biomarkers, none of the magnetic resonance imaging measures of PD are robust enough to warrant their adoption in clinical research. This study is part of a project that aims to replicate 11 PD studies reviewed in a recent survey (JAMA neurology, 78(10) 2021) to investigate the robustness of PD neuroimaging findings to data and analytical variations. Objective This study attempts to replicate the results in Hanganu et al. (Brain, 137(4) 2014) using data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Methods Using 25 PD subjects and 18 healthy controls, we analyzed the rate of change of cortical thickness and of the volume of subcortical structures, and we measured the relationship between structural changes and cognitive decline. We compared our findings to the results in the original study. Results (1) Similarly to the original study, PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibited increased cortical thinning over time compared to patients without MCI in the right middle temporal gyrus, insula, and precuneus. (2) The rate of cortical thinning in the left inferior temporal and precentral gyri in PD patients correlated with the change in cognitive performance. (3) There were no group differences in the change of subcortical volumes. (4) We did not find a relationship between the change in subcortical volumes and the change in cognitive performance. Conclusion Despite important differences in the dataset used in this replication study, and despite differences in sample size, we were able to partially replicate the original results. We produced a publicly available reproducible notebook allowing researchers to further investigate the reproducibility of the results in Hanganu et al. (2014) when more data is added to PPMI.},

	abstract = {Resting-state fMRI is commonly used to derive brain parcellations, which are widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpreting human neuroscience studies. We previously developed a model that integrates local and global approaches for estimating areal-level cortical parcellations. The resulting local-global parcellations are often referred to as the Schaefer parcellations. However, the lack of homotopic correspondence between left and right Schaefer parcels has limited their use for brain lateralization studies. Here, we extend our previous model to derive homotopic areal-level parcellations. Using resting-fMRI and task-fMRI across diverse scanners, acquisition protocols, preprocessing and demographics, we show that the resulting homotopic parcellations are as homogeneous as the Schaefer parcellations, while being more homogeneous than five publicly available parcellations. Furthermore, weaker correlations between homotopic parcels are associated with greater lateralization in resting network organization, as well as lateralization in language and motor task activation. Finally, the homotopic parcellations agree with the boundaries of a number of cortical areas estimated from histology and visuotopic fMRI, while capturing sub-areal (e.g., somatotopic and visuotopic) features. Overall, these results suggest that the homotopic local-global parcellations represent neurobiologically meaningful subdivisions of the human cerebral cortex and will be a useful resource for future studies. Multi-resolution parcellations estimated from 1479 participants are publicly available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable\_projects/brain\_parcellation/Yan2023\_homotopic).},

	abstract = {White matter hyperintensities are a marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease that are strongly related to cognition in older adults. Similarly, medial temporal lobe atrophy is well-documented in aging and Alzheimer's disease and is associated with memory decline. Here, we assessed the relationship between lobar white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, and hippocampal memory in older adults. We collected MRI scans in a sample of 139 older adults without dementia (88 females, mean age (SD) = 76.95 (10.61)). Participants were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses tested for associations among medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, regional white matter hyperintensities and memory, while adjusting for age, sex, and education and correcting for multiple comparisons. Increased occipital white matter hyperintensities were related to worse RAVLT delayed recall performance, and to reduced CA1, dentate gyrus, perirhinal cortex (Brodmann area 36), and parahippocampal cortex volumes. These medial temporal lobe subregional volumes were related to delayed recall performance. The association of occipital white matter hyperintensities with delayed recall performance was fully mediated statistically only by perirhinal cortex volume. These results suggest that white matter hyperintensities may be associated with memory decline through their impact on medial temporal lobe atrophy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vascular pathologies in memory loss in older adults and suggest that future studies should further examine the neural mechanisms of these relationships in longitudinal samples.},

In the past 10 years, we have witnessed a large increase in the use of DTI-based studies and a score of new anatomical knowledge and image analysis tools have been introduced in recent years. This review will provide an overview of the recent advancements in DTI-based studies and new image analysis tools.
RECENT FINDINGS: DTI provided new dimensions for the characterization of white matter anatomy. This characterization of the white matter can be roughly divided into two categories. First, the white matter can be parcellated into constituent white matter tracts, based on pixel-by-pixel orientation and anisotropy information. Second, the DTI information can be extrapolated to obtain three-dimensional connectivity information. Based on these capabilities of DTI, many new image analysis tools are being developed to investigate the status of the white matter.
SUMMARY: In the past, the white matter has often been treated as one compartment. With DTI and recently developed analysis tools, we can investigate the status of intra-white matter structures and deepen our understanding of white matter structures and their abnormalities under pathological conditions.},

At the same time, these developments have led to an increasing need for a high-resolution probabilistic in vivo anatomical atlas of subcortical nuclei. In order to address this need, we constructed high spatial resolution, three-dimensional templates, using high-accuracy diffeomorphic registration of T1- and T2- weighted structural images from 168 typical adults between 22 and 35 years old. In these templates, many tissue boundaries are clearly visible, which would otherwise be impossible to delineate in data from individual studies. The resulting delineations of subcortical nuclei complement current histology-based atlases. We further created a companion library of software tools for atlas development, to offer an open and evolving resource for the creation of a crowd-sourced in vivo probabilistic anatomical atlas of the human brain.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Mindboggle-101 dataset, the largest and most complete set of free, publicly accessible, manually labeled human brain images. To manually label the macroscopic anatomy in magnetic resonance images of 101 healthy participants, we created a new cortical labeling protocol that relies on robust anatomical landmarks and minimal manual edits after initialization with automated labels. The “Desikan–Killiany–Tourville” (DKT) protocol is intended to improve the ease, consistency, and accuracy of labeling human cortical areas. Given how difficult it is to label brains, the Mindboggle-101 dataset is intended to serve as brain atlases for use in labeling other brains, as a normative dataset to establish morphometric variation in a healthy population for comparison against clinical populations, and contribute to the development, training, testing, and evaluation of automated registration and labeling algorithms. To this end, we also introduce benchmarks for the evaluation of such algorithms by comparing our manual labels with labels automatically generated by probabilistic and multi-atlas registration-based approaches. All data and related software and updated information are available on the http://mindboggle.info/data website.},

	abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an increasingly important tool in mapping the functional networks of the brain. This tool has been used to examine network changes induced by cognitive and emotional states, neurological traits, and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, noise that remains in the rs-fMRI data after preprocessing has limited the reliability of individual-subject results, wherein scanner artifacts, subject movements, and other noise sources induce non-neural temporal correlations in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) timeseries. Numerous preprocessing methods have been proposed to isolate and remove these confounds; however, the field has not coalesced around a standard preprocessing pipeline. In comparisons, these preprocessing methods are often assessed with only a single metric of rs-fMRI data quality, such as reliability, without considering other aspects in tandem, such as signal-to-noise ratio and group discriminability. The present study seeks to identify the data preprocessing pipeline that optimizes rs-fMRI data across multiple outcome measures. Specifically, we aim to minimize the noise in the data and maximize result reliability, while retaining the unique features that characterize distinct groups. We examine how these metrics are influenced by bandpass filter selection and noise regression in four datasets, totaling 181 rs-fMRI scans and 38 subject-driven memory scans. Additionally, we perform two different rs-fMRI analysis methods – dual regression and region-of-interest based functional connectivity – and highlight the preprocessing parameters that optimize both approaches. Our results expand upon previous reports of individual-scan reliability, and demonstrate that preprocessing parameter selection can significantly change the noisiness, reliability, and heterogeneity of rs-fMRI data. The application of our findings to rs-fMRI data analysis should improve the validity and reliability of rs-fMRI results, both at the individual-subject level and the group level.},

In the last 10 years neuroscience spawned quantitative big-sample datasets on microanatomy, synaptic connections, optogenetic brain-behavior assays, and high-level cognition. While growing data availability and information granularity have been amply discussed, we direct attention to a routinely neglected question: How will the unprecedented data richness shape data analysis practices? Statistical reasoning is becoming more central to distill neurobiological knowledge from healthy and pathological brain recordings. We believe that large-scale data analysis will use more models that are non-parametric, generative, mixing frequentist and Bayesian aspects, and grounded in different statistical inferences.},

Here we describe some ongoing and possible future interactions among the massive data sets being collected in neuroscience, methods for their analysis and mathematical models of the underlying, still largely uncharted neural substrates that generate these data. We start by recalling events that occurred in turbulence modelling when substantial space-time velocity field measurements and numerical simulations allowed a new perspective on the governing equations of fluid mechanics. While no analogous global mathematical model of neural processes exists, we argue that big data may enable validation or at least rejection of models at cellular to brain area scales and may illuminate connections among models. We give examples of such models and survey some relatively new experimental technologies, including optogenetics and functional imaging, that can report neural activity in live animals performing complex tasks. The search for analytical techniques for these data is already yielding new mathematics, and we believe their multi-scale nature may help relate well-established models, such as the Hodgkin–Huxley equations for single neurons, to more abstract models of neural circuits, brain areas and larger networks within the brain. In brief, we envisage a closer liaison, if not a marriage, between neuroscience and mathematics.},

The aims of this study were to investigate the pattern of progressive brain atrophy in PD according to disease stage and to elucidate to what extent cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy are related to clinical motor and non-motor evolution. 154 patients at different PD stages were assessed over time using motor, non-motor and structural MRI evaluations for a maximum of 4 years. Cluster analysis defined clinical subtypes. Cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy were assessed at baseline in patients relative to 60 healthy controls. Longitudinal trends of brain atrophy progression were compared between PD clusters. The contribution of brain atrophy in predicting motor, non-motor, cognitive and mood deterioration was explored. Two main PD clusters were defined: mild (N = 87) and moderate-to-severe (N = 67). Two mild subtypes were further identified: mild motor-predominant (N = 43) and mild-diffuse (N = 44), with the latter group being older and having more severe non-motor and cognitive symptoms. The initial pattern of brain atrophy was more severe in patients with moderate-to-severe PD. Over time, mild-diffuse PD patients had the greatest brain atrophy accumulation in the cortex and the left hippocampus, while less distributed atrophy progression was observed in moderate-to-severe and mild motor-predominant patients. Baseline and 1-year cortical thinning was associated with long-term progression of motor, cognitive, non-motor and mood symptoms. Cortical and subcortical atrophy is accelerated early after the onset of PD and becomes prominent in later stages of disease according to the development of cognitive, non-motor and mood dysfunctions. Structural MRI may be useful for monitoring and predicting disease progression in PD.},

Among the cell populations, the magnocellular, cholinergic corticopetal projection neurons have received particular attention due to their loss in Alzheimer's disease. In MRI images, the precise delineation of these structures is difficult due to limited spatial resolution and contrast. Here, using microscopic delineations in ten human postmortem brains, we present stereotaxic probabilistic maps of the basal forebrain areas containing the magnocellular cell groups. Cytoarchitectonic mapping was performed in silver stained histological serial sections. The positions and the extent of the magnocellular cell groups within the septum (Ch1-2), the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (Ch3), and in the sublenticular part of the basal forebrain (Ch4) were traced in high-resolution digitized histological sections, 3D reconstructed, and warped to the reference space of the MNI single subject brain. The superposition of the cytoarchitectonic maps in the MNI brain shows the intersubject variability of the various Ch compartments and their stereotaxic position relative to other brain structures. Both the right and left Ch4 regions showed significantly smaller volumes when age was considered as a covariate. Probabilistic maps of compartments of the basal forebrain magnocellular system are now available as an open source reference for correlation with fMRI, PET, and structural MRI data of the living human brain.},

	abstract = {It has been well established that neuronal loss within the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) correlates with cognitive decline in dementing disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Friedrich Lewy first observed his eponymous inclusion bodies in the nbM of postmortem brain tissue from patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and cell loss in this area can be at least as extensive as that seen in AD. There has been confusion with regard to the terminology and exact localisation of the nbM within the human basal forebrain for decades due to the diffuse and broad structure of this “nucleus”. Also, while topographical projections from the nbM have been mapped out in subhuman primates, no direct clinicopathological correlations between subregional nbM and cortical pathology and specific cognitive profile decline have been performed in human tissue. Here, we review the evolution of the term nbM and the importance of standardised nbM sampling for neuropathological studies. Extensive review of the literature suggests that there is a caudorostral pattern of neuronal loss within the nbM in AD brains. However, the findings in PD are less clear due to the limited number of studies performed. Given the differing neuropsychiatric and cognitive deficits in Lewy body-associated dementias (PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies) as compared to AD, we hypothesise that a different pattern of neuronal loss will be found in the nbM of Lewy body disease brains. Understanding the functional significance of the subregions of the nbM could prove important in elucidating the pathogenesis of dementia in PD.},

	abstract = {White matter hyperintensities are a marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease that are strongly related to cognition in older adults. Similarly, medial temporal lobe atrophy is well-documented in aging and Alzheimer's disease and is associated with memory decline. Here, we assessed the relationship between lobar white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, and hippocampal memory in older adults. We collected MRI scans in a sample of 139 older adults without dementia (88 females, mean age (SD) = 76.95 (10.61)). Participants were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses tested for associations among medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, regional white matter hyperintensities and memory, while adjusting for age, sex, and education and correcting for multiple comparisons. Increased occipital white matter hyperintensities were related to worse RAVLT delayed recall performance, and to reduced CA1, dentate gyrus, perirhinal cortex (Brodmann area 36), and parahippocampal cortex volumes. These medial temporal lobe subregional volumes were related to delayed recall performance. The association of occipital white matter hyperintensities with delayed recall performance was fully mediated statistically only by perirhinal cortex volume. These results suggest that white matter hyperintensities may be associated with memory decline through their impact on medial temporal lobe atrophy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vascular pathologies in memory loss in older adults and suggest that future studies should further examine the neural mechanisms of these relationships in longitudinal samples.},

	abstract = {The human cerebellum plays an essential role in motor control, is involved in cognitive function (i.e., attention, working memory, and language), and helps to regulate emotional responses. Quantitative in-vivo assessment of the cerebellum is important in the study of several neurological diseases including cerebellar ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. Different structural subdivisions of the cerebellum have been shown to correlate with differing pathologies. To further understand these pathologies, it is helpful to automatically parcellate the cerebellum at the highest fidelity possible. In this paper, we coordinated with colleagues around the world to evaluate automated cerebellum parcellation algorithms on two clinical cohorts showing that the cerebellum can be parcellated to a high accuracy by newer methods. We characterize these various methods at four hierarchical levels: coarse (i.e., whole cerebellum and gross structures), lobe, subdivisions of the vermis, and the lobules. Due to the number of labels, the hierarchy of labels, the number of algorithms, and the two cohorts, we have restricted our analyses to the Dice measure of overlap. Under these conditions, machine learning based methods provide a collection of strategies that are efficient and deliver parcellations of a high standard across both cohorts, surpassing previous work in the area. In conjunction with the rank-sum computation, we identified an overall winning method.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.02.065},
	abstract = {In this paper we present a method to segment four brainstem structures (midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata and superior cerebellar peduncle) from 3D brain MRI scans. The segmentation method relies on a probabilistic atlas of the brainstem and its neighboring brain structures. To build the atlas, we combined a dataset of 39 scans with already existing manual delineations of the whole brainstem and a dataset of 10 scans in which the brainstem structures were manually labeled with a protocol that was specifically designed for this study. The resulting atlas can be used in a Bayesian framework to segment the brainstem structures in novel scans. Thanks to the generative nature of the scheme, the segmentation method is robust to changes in MRI contrast or acquisition hardware. Using cross validation, we show that the algorithm can segment the structures in previously unseen T1 and FLAIR scans with great accuracy (mean error under 1mm) and robustness (no failures in 383 scans including 168 AD cases). We also indirectly evaluate the algorithm with a experiment in which we study the atrophy of the brainstem in aging. The results show that, when used simultaneously, the volumes of the midbrain, pons and medulla are significantly more predictive of age than the volume of the entire brainstem, estimated as their sum. The results also demonstrate that the method can detect atrophy patterns in the brainstem structures that have been previously described in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to detect differential effects of AD on the brainstem structures. The method will be implemented as part of the popular neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.03.001},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical imaging data are typically stored and transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community. Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some variations can disrupt this process.
NEW METHOD: We provide some insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First, different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion. Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the DICOM conversion.
RESULTS: We present results in several error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction, effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry correction for some imaging modality.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Conversion tools are often designed for a specific manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This also serves as an overview for developers who wish to either develop their own tools or adapt the open source tools created by the authors.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

In addition to individual subject information obtained through surveys and physical examinations, a comprehensive neuroimaging battery consisting of multiple modalities provides imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that can serve as biomarkers in neuroscience research. In this study, we augment the existing set of UK Biobank neuroimaging structural IDPs, obtained from well-established software libraries such as FSL and FreeSurfer, with related measurements acquired through the Advanced Normalization Tools Ecosystem. This includes previously established cortical and subcortical measurements defined, in part, based on the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville atlas. Also included are morphological measurements from two recent developments: medial temporal lobe parcellation of hippocampal and extra-hippocampal regions in addition to cerebellum parcellation and thickness based on the Shanneman anatomical labeling. Through predictive modeling, we assess the clinical utility of these IDP measurements, individually and in combination, using commonly studied phenotypic correlates including age, fluid intelligence, numeric memory, and several other sociodemographic variables. The predictive accuracy of these IDP-based models, in terms of root-mean-squared-error or area-under-the-curve for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, provides comparative insights between software libraries as well as potential clinical interpretability. Results demonstrate varied performance between package-based IDP sets and their combination, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in their selection and utilization.},

	abstract = {We propose a new perceptual super resolution (PSR) method for 3D neuroimaging and evaluate its performance in detecting brain changes due to neurodegenerative disease. The method, concurrent super resolution and segmentation (CSRS), is trained on volumetric brain data to consistently upsample both an image intensity channel and associated segmentation labels. The simultaneous nature of the method improves not only the resolution of the images but also the resolution of associated segmentations thereby making the approach directly applicable to existing labeled datasets. One challenge to real world evaluation of SR methods such as CSRS is the lack of high resolution ground truth in the target application data: clinical neuroimages. We therefore evaluate CSRS effectiveness in an adjacent, clinically relevant signal detection problem: quantifying cross-sectional and longitudinal change across a set of phenotypically heterogeneous but related disorders that exhibit known and differentiable patterns of brain atrophy. We contrast several 3D PSR loss functions in this paradigm and show that CSRS consistently increases the ability to detect regional atrophy both longitudinally and cross-sectionally in each of five related diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNoneAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study used (or will use) ONLY openly available human data that were originally located at: https://ida.loni.usc.edu/ (in particular 4RTNI, NIFD), PPMI https://www.ppmi-info.org and http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/data/ Further details are in the manuscript.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Studies exploring the neurological correlates of repeated low-level blast exposure in career “breachers” demonstrated higher levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6 and decreases in IL-10 within brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BDEVs). The current pilot study was initiated in partnership with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to explore whether neuroinflammation is seen within special operators with prior blast exposure. Data were analyzed from 18 service members (SMs), inclusive of 9 blast-exposed special operators with an extensive career history of repeated blast exposures and 9 controls matched by age and duration of service. Neuroinflammation was assessed utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [18F]DPA-714. Serum was acquired to assess inflammatory biomarkers within whole serum and BDEVs. The Blast Exposure Threshold Survey (BETS) was acquired to determine blast history. Both self-report and neurocognitive measures were acquired to assess cognition. Similarity-driven Multi-view Linear Reconstruction (SiMLR) was used for joint analysis of acquired data. Analysis of BDEVs indicated significant positive associations with a generalized blast exposure value (GBEV) derived from the BETS. SiMLR-based analyses of neuroimaging demonstrated exposure-related relationships between GBEV, PET-neuroinflammation, cortical thickness, and volume loss within special operators. Affected brain networks included regions associated with memory retrieval and executive functioning, as well as visual and heteromodal processing. Post hoc assessments of cognitive measures failed to demonstrate significant associations with GBEV. This emerging evidence suggests neuroinflammation may be a key feature of the brain response to blast exposure over a career in operational personnel. The common thread of neuroinflammation observed in blast-exposed populations requires further study.},

	abstract = {Combat military and civilian law enforcement personnel may be exposed to repetitive low-intensity blast events during training and operations. Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as “breachers” or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Background
Once considered mere noise, fMRI-based functional connectivity has become a major neuroscience tool in part due to early studies demonstrating its reliability. These fundamental studies revealed only the tip of the iceberg; over the past decade, many test-retest reliability studies have continued to add nuance to our understanding of this complex topic. A summary of these diverse and at times contradictory perspectives is needed.
Objectives
We aimed to summarize the existing knowledge regarding test-retest reliability of functional connectivity at the most basic unit of analysis: the individual edge level. This entailed (1) a meta-analytic estimate of reliability and (2) a review of factors influencing reliability.
Methods
A search of Scopus was conducted to identify studies that estimated edge-level test-retest reliability. To facilitate comparisons across studies, eligibility was restricted to studies measuring reliability via the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The meta-analysis included a random effects pooled estimate of mean edge-level ICC, with studies nested within datasets. The review included a narrative summary of factors influencing edge-level ICC.
Results
From an initial pool of 212 studies, 44 studies were identified for the qualitative review and 25 studies for quantitative meta-analysis. On average, individual edges exhibited a “poor” ICC of 0.29 (95\% CI = 0.23 to 0.36). The most reliable measurements tended to involve: (1) stronger, within-network, cortical edges, (2) eyes open, awake, and active recordings, (3) more within-subject data, (4) shorter test-retest intervals, (5) no artifact correction (likely due in part to reliable artifact), and (6) full correlation-based connectivity with shrinkage.
Conclusion
This study represents the first meta-analysis and systematic review investigating test-retest reliability of edge-level functional connectivity. Key findings suggest there is room for improvement, but care should be taken to avoid promoting reliability at the expense of validity. By pooling existing knowledge regarding this key facet of accuracy, this study supports broader efforts to improve inferences in the field.},

	abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are sensitive to artefacts caused by in-scanner head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of numerous denoising methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts. Here, we compare popular retrospective rs-fMRI denoising methods, such as regression of head motion parameters and mean white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (with and without expansion terms), aCompCor, volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global signal regression and ICA-AROMA, combined into 19 different pipelines. These pipelines were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in four independent datasets associated with varying levels of motion. Pipelines were benchmarked by examining the residual relationship between in-scanner movement and functional connectivity after denoising; the effect of distance on this residual relationship; whole-brain differences in functional connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls (HC); the temporal degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity of each pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in independent samples of people with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our results indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional fMRI time series against head motion parameters and WM/CSF signals (with or without expansion terms) is not sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2) aCompCor pipelines may only be viable in low-motion data; (3) volume censoring performs well at minimising motion-related artefact but a major benefit of this approach derives from the exclusion of high-motion individuals; (4) while not as effective as volume censoring, ICA-AROMA performed well across our benchmarks for relatively low cost in terms of data loss; (5) the addition of global signal regression improved the performance of nearly all pipelines on most benchmarks, but exacerbated the distance-dependence of correlations between motion and functional connectivity; and (6) group comparisons in functional connectivity between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are highly dependent on preprocessing strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and outline simple analyses to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to which a given set of findings may be affected by motion-related artefact.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Functional MRI has played a fundamental role in Parkinson's disease(PD) study. In this paper, we performed an independent component analysis (ICA) based on functional networks to reveal the intricate variations on the morphology and functional properties of brain. Our analysis aims at discovering the differences between PD patients with sensorimotor function impairment and normal controls(NC), thus helping to understand the coordination neurological function degeneration in PD objectively.
Method
We investigated the blood oxygen level dependent(BOLD) functional MRI obtained at a 3.0 T MRI scanner. 30 PD patients and 28 NC subjects underwent the scan in resting state. The signals of sensory and motor coordinative control areas in the sensorimotor, insula and cerebellum networks acquired by ICA(Independent Component Analysis)were applied to analyze the functional alterations. Specifically, intra-network analysis was performed with signals in local networks, and inter-network analysis was conducted by functional network connectivity (FNC) with signals across different networks. Two sample T test was carried out to detect the significant (p {\textless} 0.05, FDR p {\textless} 0.05) functional abnormality in PD patients.
Conclusion
We identified an obvious increase in bilateral posterior insula, but decrease in bilateral cerebellum hemisphere, supplementary motor area(SMA) and precentral gyrus paracentral lobule of left postcentral gyrus. Besides, we found a significantly increased connection between independent component (IC) 13 which was located in right postcentral gyrus and cerebellum. Decreased connections were detected between sensory and motor cortex in sensorimotor network and between cerebellum and insula network by FNC analysis in PD patients as well.
Discussion
Parkinson's disease derives from the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra, and results in decreased secretion of inhibitory neurotransmitter. The significant differences between PD and NC groups in our research maybe explain the clinical manifestations of prominent bradykinesia and multiple extrapyramidal symptoms.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging techniques provide important insight into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) in-vivo. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been applied as a non-invasive tool in many studies to assess functional abnormalities observed in PD without the effects of particular motor or cognitive tasks. In this review, we summarized 50 original PD rs-fMRI studies and subdivided them based on the medication status of the patients to highlight the impact of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) when rs-fMRI was used to assess patients with PD. Although there are many different published approaches to analyzing rs-fMRI in PD, it seems that DRT plays a critical role in the functional reorganization of the brain throughout all of these approaches. In particular, studies that compared PD patients with and without medication demonstrated that DRT normalizes aberrant functional patterns in PD and leads to an improvement of PD symptoms. Thus, researchers should consider DRT as a confounding factor, which could result in misinterpretations. We suggest that performing rs-fMRI in de novo patients could be a method of choice to study the fundamental functional abnormalities in PD independent of the effects of DRT. However, it is necessary to carefully control for excessive involuntary head motions in the patients not receiving DRT. On the other hand, recruiting patients under daily DRT might be favorable to assess particular interventions in clinical routine.},

	abstract = {Brain activity during rest is characterized by slow (0.01–0.1 Hz) fluctuations of blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signals. These fluctuations are organized as functional connectivity networks called resting-state networks, anatomically corresponding to specific neuronal circuits. As Parkinson’s disease is mainly characterized by a dysfunction of the sensorimotor pathways, which can be influenced by levodopa administration, the present study investigated the functional connectivity changes within the sensorimotor resting-state network in drug-naïve patients with Parkinson’s disease after acute levodopa administration. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in 20 drug-naïve patients with Parkinson’s disease, immediately before and 60 min after, oral administration of either levodopa or placebo. Control resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were recorded in 18 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Independent component analysis was performed to extract resting-state network maps and associated time-course spectral features. At the anatomical level, levodopa enhanced the sensorimotor network functional connectivity in the supplementary motor area, a region where drug-naïve patients with Parkinson’s disease exhibited reduced signal fluctuations compared with untreated patients. At the spectral frequency level, levodopa stimulated these fluctuations in a selective frequency band of the sensorimotor network. The reported effects induced by levodopa on sensorimotor network topological and spectral features confirm that the sensorimotor system is a target of acute levodopa administration in drug-naïve patients with Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, while the regional changes in supplementary motor area reflect the functional improvement in motor function, the rhythm-specific modulation induced by the dopamine precursor discloses a novel aspect of pharmacological stimulation in Parkinson’s disease, adding further insight to the comprehension of levodopa action.},

	abstract = {The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) measures resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) signal of each voxel. However, the unit of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is arbitrary and hence ALFF is sensitive to the scale of raw signal. A well-accepted standardization procedure is to divide each voxel’s ALFF by the global mean ALFF, named mALFF. Although fractional ALFF (fALFF), a ratio of the ALFF to the total amplitude within the full frequency band, offers possible solution of the standardization, it actually mixes with the fluctuation power within the full frequency band and thus cannot reveal the true amplitude characteristics of a given frequency band. The current study borrowed the percent signal change in task fMRI studies and proposed percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) for RS-fMRI. We firstly applied PerAF and mPerAF (i.e., divided by global mean PerAF) to eyes open (EO) vs. eyes closed (EC) RS-fMRI data. PerAF and mPerAF yielded prominently difference between EO and EC, being well consistent with previous studies. We secondly performed test-retest reliability analysis and found that (PerAF ≈ mPerAF ≈ mALFF) {\textgreater} (fALFF ≈ mfALFF). Head motion regression (Friston-24) increased the reliability of PerAF, but decreased all other metrics (e.g. mPerAF, mALFF, fALFF, and mfALFF). The above results suggest that mPerAF is a valid, more reliable, more straightforward, and hence a promising metric for voxel-level RS-fMRI studies. Future study could use both PerAF and mPerAF metrics. For prompting future application of PerAF, we implemented PerAF in a new version of REST package named RESTplus.},

              measurement of cortical thickness, an important aspect of cortical organization that has historically only been conducted on postmortem brains. In this study, for the first time, we examined regional and lateralized cortical thickness in a sample of 71 chimpanzees for comparison with previously reported findings in humans. We also measured gray and white matter volumes for each subject. The results indicated that chimpanzees showed significant regional variation in cortical thickness with lower values in primary motor and sensory cortex compared with association cortex. Furthermore, chimpanzees showed significant rightward asymmetries in cortical thickness for a number of regions of interest throughout the cortex and leftward asymmetries in white but not gray matter volume. We also found that total and region-specific cortical thickness was significantly negatively correlated with white matter volume. Thus, chimpanzees with greater white matter volumes had thinner cortical thickness. The collective findings are discussed within the context of previous findings in humans and theories on the evolution of cortical organization and lateralization in primates.},

	abstract = {Background: Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative conditions. These central nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This work uses machine learning techniques  to derive such a quantitative marker from T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods: In this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based disease specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank.Findings:  1,826 dementia images from 731 participants and 3,161 healthy controls images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 participants and 232 healthy controls’ images from 145 participants from PPMI cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification performance is 0.94 [95\% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD detection and 0.63 [95\% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus and temporal brain regions in ADRD  and the substantia nigra in PD. The normalized ML model’s probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from UK Biobank. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95\% CI: 0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95\% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score is strongly associated with dementia free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95\% CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95\% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in the future.Interpretation:  Our study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression.

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients—manually annotated by up to four raters—and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74\%–85\%), illustrating the difﬁculty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This paper details the organization of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis.
DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections.
DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
It has been recently suggested that LRRK2 mutations are associated with a more benign clinical phenotype and a potentially more preserved cholinergic function in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, to our knowledge, no studies have tested whether the better clinical progression observed in LRRK2-PD patients is associated with more preserved volumes of a cholinergic brain area, the basal forebrain (BF). To address this hypothesis, here we compared BF volumes in LRRK2 carriers with and without PD with respect to idiopathic PD (iPD) patients and controls, and assessed whether they are associated with better clinical progression observed in LRRK2-PD compared to iPD.
Methods
Thirty-one symptomatic LRRK2-PD patients and 13 asymptomatic LRRK2 individuals were included from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In addition, 31 patients with iPD and 13 healthy controls matched to the previous groups were also included. BF volumes were automatically extracted from baseline T1-weighted MRI scans using a stereotactic atlas of cholinergic nuclei. These volumes were then compared between groups and their relationship with longitudinal cognitive changes was evaluated using linear mixed effects models. Mediation analyses assessed whether BF volumes mediated differences in cognitive trajectories between groups.
Results
LRRK2-PD patients showed significantly higher BF volumes compared to iPD (P = 0.019) as did asymptomatic LRRK2 subjects compared to controls (P = 0.008). There were no other significant differences in cortical regions or subcortical volumes between these groups. BF volumes predicted longitudinal decline in several cognitive functions in iPD patients but not in LRRK2-PD, who did not show cognitive changes over a 4-year follow-up period. BF volumes were a significant mediator of the different cognitive trajectories between iPD and LRRK2-PD patients (95\% CI 0.056–2.955).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that mutations in LRRK2 are associated with increased BF volumes, potentially reflecting a compensatory hypercholinergic state that could prevent cognitive decline in LRRK2-PD patients.},

Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package).

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model.

	abstract = {This paper defines partial residuals in multiple linear regression. The ith partial residual vector can be thought of as the dependent variable vector corrected for all independent variables except the ith variable. A plot of the ith partial residuals vs values of the ith variable is proposed as a replacement for the usual plot displaying ordinary residuals vs the ith independent variable. This partial residual plot shows the extent and direction of linearity, while displaying deviations from linearity, such as outliers, inhomogeneity of variance, and curvilinear relationships. Some alternative definitions of partial residuals are described.},
