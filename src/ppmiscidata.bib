	abstract  { methylation is an epigenetic moification that plays an important role in regulating gene expression an therefore a broa range of biological processes an iseases.  methylation is tissue-specific, ynamic, sequence-context-epenent an trans-generationally heritable, an these complex patterns of methylation highlight the significance of profiling  methylation to answer biological questions. n this review, we surveye major methylation assays, along with comparisons an biological examples, to provie an overview of  methylation profiling techniques. he avances in microarray an sequencing technologies make genome-wie profiling possible at a single-nucleotie or even a single-cell resolution. hese profiling approaches vary in many aspects, such as  input, resolution, genomic region coverage, an bioinformatics analysis, an selecting a feasible metho requires knowlege of these methos. e first introuce the biological backgroun of  methylation an its pattern in plants, animals an fungi. e present an overview of major experimental approaches to profiling genome-wie  methylation an hyroxymethylation an then exten to the single-cell methylome. o evaluate these methos, we outline their strengths an weaknesses an perform comparisons across the ifferent platforms. ue to the increasing nee to compute high-throughput epigenomic ata, we interrogate the computational pipeline for bisulfite sequencing ata an also iscuss the concept of ientifying ifferentially methylate regions (s). his review summarizes the experimental an computational concepts for profiling genome-wie  methylation, followe by biological examples. verall, this review provies researchers useful guiance for the selection of a profiling metho suite to specific research questions.},

	abstract  {he accurate preiction of a cancer patient's risk of progression or eath can guie clinicians in the selection of treatment an help patients in planning personal affairs. reictive moels base on patient-level ata represent a tool for etermining risk. eally, preictive moels will use multiple sources of ata (e.g., clinical, emographic, molecular, etc.). owever, there are many challenges associate with ata integration, such as overfitting an reunant features. n this paper we aim to aress those challenges through the evelopment of a novel feature selection an feature reuction framework that can hanle correlate ata. ur metho begins by computing a survival istance score for gene expression, which in combination with a score for clinical inepenence, results in the selection of highly preictive genes that are non-reunant with clinical features. he survival istance score is a measure of variation of gene expression over time, weighte by the variance of the gene expression over all patients. electe genes, in combination with clinical ata, are use to buil a preictive moel for survival. e benchmark our approach against commonly use methos, namely lasso-as well as rige-penalize ox proportional hazars moels, using three publicly available cancer ata sets kiney cancer ( samples), lung cancer (44 samples) an blaer cancer (33 samples). cross all ata sets, our approach built on the training set outperforme the clinical ata alone in the test set in terms of preictive power with a c.nex of 0.773 vs 0.7 for kiney cancer, 0.6 vs 0.664 for lung cancer an 0.64 vs 0.636 for blaer cancer. urther, we were able to show increase preictive performance of our metho compare to lasso-penalize moels fit to both gene expression an clinical ata, which ha a c.nex of 0.767, 0.677, an 0.64, as well as increase or comparable preictive power compare to rige moels, which ha a c.nex of 0.773, 0.66 an 0.60 for the kiney, lung, an blaer cancer ata sets, respectively. herefore, our score for clinical inepenence improves prognostic performance as compare to moeling approaches that o not consier combining non-reunant ata. uture work will concentrate on optimizing the survival istance score in orer to achieve improve results for all types of cancer.},

	abstract  {s clinical an cognitive neuroscience mature, the nee for sophisticate neuroimaging analysis becomes more apparent. ultivariate analysis techniques have recently receive increasing attention as they have many attractive features that cannot be easily realize by the more commonly use univariate, voxel-wise, techniques. ultivariate approaches evaluate correlation/covariance of activation across brain regions, rather than proceeing on a voxel-by-voxel basis. hus, their results can be more easily interprete as a signature of neural networks. nivariate approaches, on the other han, cannot irectly aress functional connectivity in the brain. he covariance approach can also result in greater statistical power when compare with univariate techniques, which are force to employ very stringent, an often overly conservative, corrections for voxel-wise multiple comparisons. ultivariate techniques also len themselves much better to prospective application of results from the analysis of one ataset to entirely new atasets. ultivariate techniques are thus well place to provie information about mean ifferences an correlations with behavior, similarly to univariate approaches, with potentially greater statistical power an better reproucibility checks. n contrast to these avantages is the high barrier of entry to the use of multivariate approaches, preventing more wiesprea application in the community. o the neuroscientist becoming familiar with multivariate analysis techniques, an initial survey of the fiel might present a bewilering variety of approaches that, although algorithmically similar, are presente with ifferent emphases, typically by people with mathematics backgrouns. e believe that multivariate analysis techniques have sufficient potential to warrant better issemination. esearchers shoul be able to employ them in an informe an accessible manner. he following article attempts to provie a basic introuction with sample applications to simulate an real-worl ata sets.},

	abstract  {n psychology, attempts to replicate publishe finings are less successful than expecte. or properly powere stuies replication rate shoul be aroun 0%, whereas in practice less than 40% of the stuies selecte from ifferent areas of psychology can be replicate. esearchers in cognitive psychology are hinere in estimating the power of their stuies, because the esigns they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covere by most power formulas. o remey the situation, we review the literature relate to the topic an introuce recent software packages, which we apply to the ata of two maske priming stuies with high power. e checke how we coul estimate the power of each stuy an how much they coul be reuce to remain powerful enough. n the basis of this analysis, we recommen that a properly powere reaction time experiment with repeate measures has at least ,600 wor observations per conition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). his is consierably more than current practice. e also show that researchers must inclue the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reporte epen on the number of stimuli presente to the participants. ur analyses can easily be applie to new atasets gathere.},

	abstract  { umor classification is inexact an largely epenent on the qualitative pathological examination of the images of the tumor tissue slies. n this stuy, our aim was to evelop an automate computational metho to classify ematoxylin an osin (&) staine tissue sections base on cancer tissue texture features.  mage processing of histology slie images was use to etect an ientify aipose tissue, extracellular matrix, morphologically istinct cell nuclei types, an the tubular architecture. he texture parameters erive from image analysis were then applie to classify images in a supervise classification scheme using histologic grae of a testing set as guiance.  he histologic grae assigne by pathologists to invasive breast carcinoma images strongly correlate with both the presence an extent of cell nuclei with isperse chromatin an the architecture, specifically the extent of presence of tubular cross sections. he two parameters that ifferentiate tumor grae foun in this stuy were () the number ensity of cell nuclei with isperse chromatin an () the number ensity of tubular cross sections ientifie through image processing as white blobs that were surroune by a continuous string of cell nuclei. lassification base on subivisions of a whole slie image containing a high concentration of cancer cell nuclei consistently agree with the grae classification of the entire slie.  he automate image analysis an classification presente in this stuy emonstrate the feasibility of eveloping clinically relevant classification of histology images base on micro- texture. his metho provies pathologists an invaluable quantitative tool for evaluation of the components of the ottingham system for breast tumor graing an avoi intra-observer variability thus increasing the consistency of the ecision-making process.},

	abstract  {lthough the iscovery of the critical role of α-synuclein (α-syn) in the pathogenesis of arkinson’s isease () is now twenty-five years ol, it still represents a milestone in  research. bnormal forms of α-syn trigger selective an progressive neuronal eath through mitochonrial impairment, lysosomal ysfunction, an alteration of calcium homeostasis not only in  but also in other α-syn-relate neuroegenerative isorers such as ementia with ewy boies, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, an  sleep behavior isorer. urthermore, α-syn-epenent early synaptic an plastic alterations an the unerlying mechanisms preceing overt neuroegeneration have attracte great interest. n particular, the presence of early inflammation in experimental moels an  patients, occurring before eposition an spreaing of α-syn, suggests a mechanistic link between inflammation an synaptic ysfunction. he knowlege of these early mechanisms is of seminal importance to support the research on reliable biomarkers to precociously ientify the isease an possible isease-moifying therapies targeting α-syn. n this review, we will iscuss these critical issues, proviing a state of the art of the role of this protein in early  an other synucleinopathies.},

	abstract  {lassical accounts of the pathophysiology of arkinson’s isease have emphasize egeneration of opaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with consequent ysfunction of cortico–striatal–thalamic loops. n contrast, post-mortem stuies inicate that pathological changes in arkinson’s isease (ewy neurites an ewy boies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. he nigrostriatal an histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they o emphasize ifferent anatomical structures. o aress the question of which brain structures are functionally most affecte by arkinson’s isease, we performe a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging stuy focuse on striatal functional connectivity. e contraste 3 patients with avance arkinson’s isease versus  age-matche control subjects, using methoology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of hea motion uring scanning. he principal fining in the arkinson’s isease group was markely lower striatal correlations with thalamus, mibrain, pons an cerebellum. his result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of arkinson’s isease. ocally altere functional connectivity also was observe in sensori-motor an visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. triatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was grae (posterior putamen &gt anterior putamen &gt cauate), in both patients with arkinson’s isease an control subjects, in a manner that correspons to well-ocumente graient of striatal opaminergic function loss in arkinson’s isease. e hypothesize that this graient provies a clue to the pathogenesis of arkinson’s isease.},

	abstract  { merging evience shows that α-synuclein see amplification assays (s) have the potential to ifferentiate people with arkinson's isease from healthy controls. e use the well characterise, multicentre arkinson's rogression arkers nitiative () cohort to further assess the iagnostic performance of the α-synuclein  an to examine whether the assay ientifies heterogeneity among patients an enables the early ientification of at-risk groups.
 his cross-sectional analysis is base on assessments one at enrolment for  participants (incluing people with sporaic arkinson's isease from  an  variants, healthy controls, proromal iniviuals with either rapi eye movement sleep behaviour isorer () or hyposmia, an non-manifesting carriers of  an  variants) from 33 participating acaemic neurology outpatient practices worlwie (in ustria, anaa, rance, ermany, reece, srael, taly, the etherlans, orway, pain, the , an the ). α-synuclein  analysis of  was performe using previously escribe methos. e assesse the sensitivity an specificity of the α-synuclein  in participants with arkinson's isease an healthy controls, incluing subgroups base on genetic an clinical features. e establishe the frequency of positive α-synuclein  results in proromal participants ( an hyposmia) an non-manifesting carriers of genetic variants associate with arkinson's isease, an compare α-synuclein  to clinical measures an other biomarkers. e use os ratio estimates with % s to measure the association between α-synuclein  status an categorical measures, an two-sample % s from the resampling metho to assess ifferences in meians between α-synuclein  positive an negative participants for continuous measures.  linear regression moel was use to control for potential confouners such as age an sex.
 his analysis inclue 3 participants who were enrolle between uly 7, 00, an uly 4, 0. f these, 4 ha arkinson's isease, 63 were healthy controls, 4 were participants with scans without evience of opaminergic eficit,  were proromal participants, an 30 were non-manifesting carriers. ensitivity for arkinson's isease was 7·7% (%  4·-0·), an specificity for healthy controls was 6·3% (3·4-·). he sensitivity of the α-synuclein  in sporaic arkinson's isease with the typical olfactory eficit was ·6% (6·4-·4). he proportion of positive α-synuclein  was lower than this figure in subgroups incluing  arkinson's isease (67·% ·-7·]) an participants with sporaic arkinson's isease without olfactory eficit (7·3% 6·-6·7]). articipants with  variant an normal olfaction ha an even lower α-synuclein  positivity rate (34·7% ·4-4·0]). mong proromal an at-risk groups, 44 (6%) of  of participants with  or hyposmia ha positive α-synuclein  (6 of  with hyposmia, an  of 33 with ).  (%) of 30 non-manifesting carriers (4 of  %]  an  of  7%] ) were positive.
 his stuy represents the largest analysis so far of the α-synuclein  for the biochemical iagnosis of arkinson's isease. ur results show that the assay classifies people with arkinson's isease with high sensitivity an specificity, provies information about molecular heterogeneity, an etects proromal iniviuals before iagnosis. hese finings suggest a crucial role for the α-synuclein  in therapeutic evelopment, both to ientify pathologically efine subgroups of people with arkinson's isease an to establish biomarker-efine at-risk cohorts.
