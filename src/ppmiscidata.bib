abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that cortical and hippocampal volumes, measured in vivo from volumetric MRI (vMRI) scans, could be used to identify variant subtypes of Alzheimer disease (AD) and to prospectively predict the rate of clinical decline. Methods: Amyloid-positive participants with AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 1 and ADNI2 with baseline MRI scans (n = 229) and 2-year clinical follow-up (n = 100) were included. AD subtypes (hippocampal sparing [HpSpMRI], limbic predominant [LPMRI], typical AD [tADMRI]) were defined according to an algorithm analogous to one recently proposed for tau neuropathology. Relationships between baseline hippocampal volume to cortical volume ratio (HV:CTV) and clinical variables were examined by both continuous regression and categorical models. Results: When participants were divided categorically, the HpSpMRI group showed significantly more AD-like hypometabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (p {\textless} 0.05) and poorer baseline executive function (p {\textless} 0.001). Other baseline clinical measures did not differ across the 3 groups. Participants with HpSpMRI also showed faster subsequent clinical decline than participants with LPMRI on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, 13-Item Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (all p {\textless} 0.05) and tADMRI on the MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) (both p {\textless} 0.05). Finally, a larger HV:CTV was associated with poorer baseline executive function and a faster slope of decline in CDR-SB, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog13 score (p {\textless} 0.05). These associations were driven mostly by the amount of cortical rather than hippocampal atrophy. Conclusions: AD subtypes with phenotypes consistent with those observed with tau neuropathology can be identified in vivo with vMRI. An increased HV:CTV ratio was predictive of faster clinical decline in participants with AD who were clinically indistinguishable at baseline except for a greater dysexecutive presentation.},

Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network architectures and trained models for specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These pipelines significantly improve computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs workflows and simultaneously illustrate the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework for medical image analysis.},

We also measured gray and white matter volumes for each subject. The results indicated that chimpanzees showed significant regional variation in cortical thickness with lower values in primary motor and sensory cortex compared with association cortex. Furthermore, chimpanzees showed significant rightward asymmetries in cortical thickness for a number of regions of interest throughout the cortex and leftward asymmetries in white but not gray matter volume. We also found that total and region-specific cortical thickness was significantly negatively correlated with white matter volume. Thus, chimpanzees with greater white matter volumes had thinner cortical thickness.

	abstract = {Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy {\textendash} Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) are often represented by similar clinical symptoms, which may challenge diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare regional cerebral diffusion properties in PD and PSP-RS subjects and evaluate the use of these metrics for an automatic classification framework.
Material and methods
Diffusion-tensor MRI datasets from 52 PD and 21 PSP-RS subjects were employed for this study. Using an atlas-based approach, regional median values of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were measured and employed for feature selection using RELIEFF and subsequent classification using a support vector machine.
Results
According to RELIEFF, the top 17 diffusion values consisting of deep gray matter structures, the brainstem, and frontal cortex were found to be especially informative for an automatic classification. A MANCOVA analysis performed on these diffusion values as dependent variables revealed that PSP-RS and PD subjects differ significantly (p {\textless} .001). Generally, PSP-RS subjects exhibit reduced FA, and increased MD, RD, and AD values in nearly all brain structures analyzed compared to PD subjects. The leave-one-out cross-validation of the support vector machine classifier revealed that the classifier can differentiate PD and PSP-RS subjects with an accuracy of 87.7\%. More precisely, six PD subjects were wrongly classified as PSP-RS and three PSP-RS subjects were wrongly classified as PD.
Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that PSP-RS subjects exhibit widespread and more severe diffusion alterations compared to PD patients, which appears valuable for an automatic computer-aided diagnosis approach.},

	abstract = {Non-manifesting carriers (NMCs) of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD)-related mutations such as LRRK2 and GBA are at an increased risk for developing PD. Dopamine transporter (DaT)-spectral positron emission computed tomography is widely used for capturing functional nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity. However, it does not reflect other ongoing neuronal processes; especially in the prodromal stages of the disease. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been proposed as a mode for assessing functional alterations associated with PD, but its relation to dopaminergic deficiency remains unclear. We aimed to study the association between presynaptic striatal dopamine uptake and functional connectivity (FC) patterns among healthy first-degree relatives of PD patients with mutations in LRRK2 and GBA genes. N = 85 healthy first-degree subjects were enrolled and genotyped. All participants underwent DaT and rs-fMRI scans, as well as a comprehensive clinical assessment battery. Between-group differences in FC within striatal regions were investigated and compared with striatal binding ratios (SBR). N = 26 GBA-NMCs, N = 25 LRRK2-NMCs, and N = 34 age-matched nonmanifesting noncarriers (NM-NCs) were included in each study group based on genetic status. While genetically-defined groups were similar across clinical measures, LRRK2-NMCs demonstrated lower SBR in the right putamen compared with NM-NCs, and higher right putamen FC compared to GBA-NMCs. In this group, higher striatal FC was associated with increased risk for PD. The observed differential SBR and FC patterns among LRRK2-NMCs and GBA-NMCs indicate that DaTscan and FC assessments might offer a more sensitive prediction of the risk for PD in the pre-clinical stages of the disease.},

Abnormal forms of $\alpha$-syn trigger selective and progressive neuronal death through mitochondrial impairment, lysosomal dysfunction, and alteration of calcium homeostasis not only in PD but also in other $\alpha$-syn-related neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Furthermore, $\alpha$-syn-dependent early synaptic and plastic alterations and the underlying mechanisms preceding overt neurodegeneration have attracted great interest. In particular, the presence of early inflammation in experimental models and PD patients, occurring before deposition and spreading of $\alpha$-syn, suggests a mechanistic link between inflammation and synaptic dysfunction. The knowledge of these early mechanisms is of seminal importance to support the research on reliable biomarkers to precociously identify the disease and possible disease-modifying therapies targeting $\alpha$-syn. In this review, we will discuss these critical issues, providing a state of the art of the role of this protein in early PD and other synucleinopathies.},

	abstract = {Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with the misfolding and aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy1. Clinically, it is challenging to differentiate Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, especially at the early stages of disease2. Aggregates of $\alpha$-synuclein in distinct synucleinopathies have been proposed to represent different conformational strains of $\alpha$-synuclein that can self-propagate and spread from cell to cell3-6. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is a technique that has~previously been used to detect $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates in samples of cerebrospinal fluid with high sensitivity and specificity7,8. Here we show that the $\alpha$-synuclein-PMCA assay can discriminate between samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and samples from patients with multiple system atrophy, with an overall sensitivity of 95.4\%. We used a combination of biochemical, biophysical and biological methods to analyse the product of $\alpha$-synuclein-PMCA, and found that the characteristics of the $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates in the cerebrospinal fluid could be used to readily distinguish between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. We also found that the properties of aggregates that were amplified from the cerebrospinal fluid were similar to those of aggregates that were amplified from the brain. These findings suggest that $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates that are associated with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy correspond to different conformational strains of $\alpha$-synuclein, which can be amplified and detected by $\alpha$-synuclein-PMCA. Our results may help to improve our understanding of the mechanism of $\alpha$-synuclein misfolding and the structures of the aggregates that are implicated in different synucleinopathies, and may also enable the development of a biochemical assay to discriminate between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.},

METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis is based on assessments done at enrolment for PPMI participants (including people with sporadic Parkinson's disease from LRRK2 and GBA variants, healthy controls, prodromal individuals with either rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) or hyposmia, and non-manifesting carriers of LRRK2 and GBA variants) from 33 participating academic neurology outpatient practices worldwide (in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK, and the USA). $\alpha$-synuclein SAA analysis of CSF was performed using previously described methods. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the $\alpha$-synuclein SAA in participants with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, including subgroups based on genetic and clinical features. We established the frequency of positive $\alpha$-synuclein SAA results in prodromal participants (RBD and hyposmia) and non-manifesting carriers of genetic variants associated with Parkinson's disease, and compared $\alpha$-synuclein SAA to clinical measures and other biomarkers. We used odds ratio estimates with 95\% CIs to measure the association between $\alpha$-synuclein SAA status and categorical measures, and two-sample 95\% CIs from the resampling method to assess differences in medians between $\alpha$-synuclein SAA positive and negative participants for continuous measures. A linear regression model was used to control for potential confounders such as age and sex.
FINDINGS: This analysis included 1123 participants who were enrolled between July 7, 2010, and July 4, 2019. Of these, 545 had Parkinson's disease, 163 were healthy controls, 54 were participants with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit, 51 were prodromal participants, and 310 were non-manifesting carriers. Sensitivity for Parkinson's disease was 87{\textperiodcentered}7\% (95\% CI 84{\textperiodcentered}9-90{\textperiodcentered}5), and specificity for healthy controls was 96{\textperiodcentered}3\% (93{\textperiodcentered}4-99{\textperiodcentered}2). The sensitivity of the $\alpha$-synuclein SAA in sporadic Parkinson's disease with the typical olfactory deficit was 98{\textperiodcentered}6\% (96{\textperiodcentered}4-99{\textperiodcentered}4). The proportion of positive $\alpha$-synuclein SAA was lower than this figure in subgroups including LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (67{\textperiodcentered}5\% [59{\textperiodcentered}2-75{\textperiodcentered}8]) and participants with sporadic Parkinson's disease without olfactory deficit (78{\textperiodcentered}3\% [69{\textperiodcentered}8-86{\textperiodcentered}7]). Participants with LRRK2 variant and normal olfaction had an even lower $\alpha$-synuclein SAA positivity rate (34{\textperiodcentered}7\% [21{\textperiodcentered}4-48{\textperiodcentered}0]). Among prodromal and at-risk groups, 44 (86\%) of 51 of participants with RBD or hyposmia had positive $\alpha$-synuclein SAA (16 of 18 with hyposmia, and 28 of 33 with RBD). 25 (8\%) of 310 non-manifesting carriers (14 of 159 [9\%] LRRK2 and 11 of 151 [7\%] GBA) were positive.
INTERPRETATION: This study represents the largest analysis so far of the $\alpha$-synuclein SAA for the biochemical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Our results show that the assay classifies people with Parkinson's disease with high sensitivity and specificity, provides information about molecular heterogeneity, and detects prodromal individuals before diagnosis. These findings suggest a crucial role for the $\alpha$-synuclein SAA in therapeutic development, both to identify pathologically defined subgroups of people with Parkinson's disease and to establish biomarker-defined at-risk cohorts.

	abstract = {Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) are two parkinsonian syndromes that share many symptoms, albeit having very different prognosis. Although previous studies have proposed multimodal MRI protocols combined with multivariate analysis to discriminate between these two populations and healthy controls, studies combining all MRI indexes relevant for these disorders (i.e. grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, iron deposition, brain activity at rest and brain connectivity) with a completely data-driven voxelwise analysis for discrimination are still lacking. In this study, we used such a complete MRI protocol and adapted a fully-data driven analysis pipeline to discriminate between these populations and a healthy controls (HC) group. The pipeline combined several feature selection and reduction steps to obtain interpretable models with a low number of discriminant features that can shed light onto the brain pathology of PD and MSA. Using this pipeline, we could discriminate between PD and HC (best accuracy = 0.78), MSA and HC (best accuracy = 0.94) and PD and MSA (best accuracy = 0.88). Moreover, we showed that indexes derived from resting-state fMRI alone could discriminate between PD and HC, while mean diffusivity in the cerebellum and the putamen alone could discriminate between MSA and HC. On the other hand, a more diverse set of indexes derived by multiple modalities was needed to discriminate between the two disorders. We showed that our pipeline was able to discriminate between distinct pathological populations while delivering sparse model that could be used to better understand the neural underpinning of the pathologies.},

	abstract = {Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease varies in severity and age of onset. One source of this variability is sex. Males are twice as likely as females to develop Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease, and tend to have more severe symptoms and greater speed of progression. However, to date, there is little information in large cohorts on sex differences in the patterns of neurodegeneration. Here we used MRI and clinical information from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative to measure structural brain differences between sexes in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease after regressing out the expected effect of age and sex. We derived atrophy maps from deformation-based morphometry of T1-weighted MRI and connectivity from diffusion-weighted MRI in de novo Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease patients (149 males: 83 females) with comparable clinical severity, and healthy control participants (78 males: 39 females). Overall, even though the two patient groups were matched for disease duration and severity, males demonstrated generally greater brain atrophy and disrupted connectivity. Males with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease had significantly greater tissue loss than females in 11 cortical regions including bilateral frontal and left insular lobe, right postcentral gyrus, left inferior temporal and cingulate gyrus and left thalamus, while females had greater atrophy in six cortical regions, including regions in the left frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, left insular gyrus and right occipital cortex. Local efficiency of white matter connectivity showed greater disruption in males in multiple regions such as basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. These findings support the idea that development of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease may involve different pathological mechanisms and yield distinct prognosis in males and females, which may have implications for research into neuroprotection, and stratification for clinical trials.},

However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the {\textquotedblleft}average{\textquotedblright} patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method{\textemdash}similarity network fusion{\textemdash}to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease from the Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from the fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.},

Persons who use explosives to gain entry (i.e., breach) into buildings are known as {\textquotedblleft}breachers{\textquotedblright} or dynamic entry personnel. Breachers operate under the guidance of established safety protocols, but despite these precautions, breachers who are exposed to low-level blast throughout their careers frequently report performance deficits and symptoms to healthcare providers. Although little is known about the etiology linking blast exposure to clinical symptoms in humans, animal studies demonstrate network-level changes in brain function, alterations in brain morphology, vascular and inflammatory changes, hearing loss, and even alterations in gene expression after repeated blast exposure. To explore whether similar effects occur in humans, we collected a comprehensive data battery from 20 experienced breachers exposed to blast throughout their careers and 14 military and law enforcement controls. This battery included neuropsychological assessments, blood biomarkers, and magnetic resonance imaging measures, including cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, functional connectivity, and perfusion. To better understand the relationship between repetitive low-level blast exposure and behavioral and imaging differences in humans, we analyzed the data using similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR). SiMLR is specifically designed for multiple modality statistical integration using dimensionality-reduction techniques for studies with high-dimensional, yet sparse, data (i.e., low number of subjects and many data per subject). We identify significant group effects in these data spanning brain structure, function, and blood biomarkers.},

In this study, three traveling subjects were scanned at eight imaging centers equipped with the same type of scanners using the same multi-shell diffusion imaging protocol. Track density imaging and structure connectomes were investigated in local-scale distribution and in distal-scale connectivity, respectively. With evaluations of the coefficient of variation and the intra-class correlation coefficient, our results indicated: 1) similar to single-shell schemes, the intra-center reproducibility of multi-shell is higher than inter-center; 2) multi-shell schemes produce higher reproducibility and precision among centers compared to the single-shell schemes; and 3) in addition to the diffusion schemes, image quality and the presence of complex fiber structure could also associated with multicenter reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Depigmentation of the substantia nigra is a conspicuous pathological feature of Parkinson's disease and related to a loss of neuromelanin. Similar to melanin, neuromelanin has paramagnetic properties resulting in signal increase on specific T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was to assess signal changes in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease using an optimized neuromelanin-sensitive T1 scan. Ten patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 matched controls underwent high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with magnetization transfer effect at 3T. The size and signal intensity of the substantia nigra pars compacta were determined as the number of pixels with signal intensity higher than background signal intensity + 3 standard deviations and regional contrast ratio. Patients were subclassified as early stage (n = 6) and late stage (n = 4) using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr Parkinson's disease staging scale. The T1 hyperintense area in the substantia nigra was substantially smaller in patients compared with controls (-60\%, P {\textless} .01), and contrast was reduced (-3\%, P {\textless} .05). Size reduction was even more pronounced in more advanced disease (-78\%) than in early-stage disease (-47\%). We present preliminary findings using a modified T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging technique showing stage-dependent substantia nigra signal reduction in Parkinson's disease as a putative marker of neuromelanin loss. Our data suggest that reduction in the size of neuromelanin-rich substantia nigra correlates well with postmortem observations of dopaminergic neuron loss. Further validation of our results could potentially lead to development of a new biomarker of disease progression in Parkinson's disease. {\textcopyright} 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

	abstract = {This study focused on the substantia nigra (SN) in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD). We measured its area and volume, mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and iron concentration in early and late PD and correlated the values with clinical scores. Twenty-two early PD (EPD), 20 late PD (LPD) and 20 healthy subjects (age 64.7~{\textpm}~4.9, 60.5~{\textpm}~6.1, and 61~{\textpm}~7.2~years, respectively) underwent 1.5~T MR imaging with double-TI-IR T1-weighted, T2*-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. Relative SN area, MD, FA and R2* were measured in ROIs traced on SN. Correlation with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores was assessed. In LPD, the SN area was significantly reduced with respect to EPD (p~=~0.04) and control subjects (p~{\textless}~0.001). In EPD, the SN area was also significantly smaller than in controls (p~=~0.006). Similarly, the SN volume significantly differed between LPD and controls (p~=~0.001) and between EPD and LPD (p~=~0.049), while no significant differences were found between controls and EPD. Both SN area (r~=~0.47, p~=~0.004) and volume (r~=~0.46, p~=~0.005) correlated with UPDRS scores. At 1.5~T, SN morphological measurements were sensitive to early PD changes and able to track the disease progression, while MD and FA measures and relaxometry did not provide significant results.},

	abstract = {One objective of modern neuroimaging is to identify markers that can aid in diagnosis, disease progression monitoring and long-term drug impact analysis. In this study, Parkinson-associated physiopathological modifications were characterized in six subcortical structures by simultaneously measuring quantitative magnetic resonance parameters sensitive to complementary tissue characteristics (i.e. volume atrophy, iron deposition and microstructural damage). Thirty patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease and 22 control subjects underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging with T2*-weighted, whole-brain T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. The mean R2* value, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy in the pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, substantia nigra and red nucleus were compared between patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease and control subjects. Comparisons were also performed using voxel-based analysis of R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps to determine which subregion of the basal ganglia showed the greater difference for each parameter. Averages of each subregion were then used in a logistic regression analysis. Compared with control subjects, patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease displayed significantly higher R2* values in the substantia nigra, lower fractional anisotropy values in the substantia nigra and thalamus, and higher mean diffusivity values in the thalamus. Voxel-based analyses confirmed these results and, in addition, showed a significant difference in the mean diffusivity in the striatum. The combination of three markers was sufficient to obtain a 95\% global accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for discriminating patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease from controls. The markers comprising discriminating combinations were R2* in the substantia nigra, fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra and mean diffusivity in the putamen or caudate nucleus. Remarkably, the predictive markers involved the nigrostriatal structures that characterize Parkinson{\textquoteright}s physiopathology. Furthermore, highly discriminating combinations included markers from three different magnetic resonance parameters (R2*, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy). These findings demonstrate that multimodal magnetic resonance imaging of subcortical grey matter structures is useful for the evaluation of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease and, possibly, of other subcortical pathologies.},

LRRK2 mutations, and particularly the most common mutation Gly2019Ser, are observed in patients with~autosomal dominant PD and in those with apparent sporadic PD, who are clinically indistinguishable from those with idiopathic PD. The discoveries that pathogenic mutations in~the LRRK2 gene increase LRRK2 kinase activity and that small-molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors can be neuroprotective in preclinical models of PD have placed LRRK2 at the centre of disease modification efforts in PD. Recent investigations also suggest that LRRK2 has a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD and that LRRK2 therapies might, therefore, be beneficial in this common subtype of PD. In this Review, we describe the characteristics of LRRK2-associated PD that are most relevant to the development of LRRK2-targeted therapies and the design and implementation of clinical trials. We highlight strategies for correcting the effects of mutations in~the LRRK2 gene, focusing on how to identify which patients are the optimal candidates and how to decide on the timing of such trials. In addition, we discuss challenges in implementing trials of disease-modifying treatment in people who carry LRRK2 mutations.},

	abstract = {Classical accounts of the pathophysiology of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease have emphasized degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with consequent dysfunction of cortico{\textendash}striatal{\textendash}thalamic loops. In contrast, post-mortem studies indicate that pathological changes in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. The nigrostriatal and histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they do emphasize different anatomical structures. To address the question of which brain structures are functionally most affected by Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease, we performed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study focused on striatal functional connectivity. We contrasted 13 patients with advanced Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease versus 19 age-matched control subjects, using methodology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of head motion during scanning. The principal finding in the Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease group was markedly lower striatal correlations with thalamus, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. This result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. Focally altered functional connectivity also was observed in sensori-motor and visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. Striatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was graded (posterior putamen \&gt; anterior putamen \&gt; caudate), in both patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease and control subjects, in a manner that corresponds to well-documented gradient of striatal dopaminergic function loss in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. We hypothesize that this gradient provides a clue to the pathogenesis of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease.},

	abstract = {See Nieuwhof and Helmich (doi:10.1093/brain/awx267) for a scientific commentary on this article.Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Previous studies measuring spontaneous brain activity using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging have reported abnormal changes in broadly distributed whole-brain networks. Although resting state functional connectivity, estimating temporal correlations between brain regions, is measured with the assumption that intrinsic fluctuations throughout the scan are stable, dynamic changes of functional connectivity have recently been suggested to reflect aspects of functional capacity of neural systems, and thus may serve as biomarkers of disease. The present work is the first study to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity in patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease, with a focus on the temporal properties of functional connectivity states as well as the variability of network topological organization using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-one Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease patients and 23 healthy controls were studied using group spatial independent component analysis, a sliding windows approach, and graph-theory methods. The dynamic functional connectivity analyses suggested two discrete connectivity configurations: a more frequent, sparsely connected within-network state (State I) and a less frequent, more strongly interconnected between-network state (State II). In patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease, the occurrence of the sparsely connected State I dropped by 12.62\%, while the expression of the more strongly interconnected State II increased by the same amount. This was consistent with the altered temporal properties of the dynamic functional connectivity characterized by a shortening of the dwell time of State I and by a proportional increase of the dwell time pattern in State II. These changes are suggestive of a reduction in functional segregation among networks and are correlated with the clinical severity of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease symptoms. Additionally, there was a higher variability in the network global efficiency, suggesting an abnormal global integration of the brain networks. The altered functional segregation and abnormal global integration in brain networks confirmed the vulnerability of functional connectivity networks in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease.},

	abstract = {The substantia nigra contains dopaminergic cells that project to the striatum and are affected by the neurodegenerative process that appears in Parkinson's disease (PD). For accurate differential diagnosis and for disease monitoring the availability of a sensitive and non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease would be essential. Although there has been notable progress in studying correlates of nigral degeneration by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the past decade, MRI and analysis techniques that allow accurate high-resolution mapping of the SN within a clinically acceptable acquisition time are still elusive. The main purpose of the preliminary study was to evaluate the potential role of the driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) method for delineation of the SN and differentiation of PD patients from healthy control subjects (n=10 in each group). We also investigated whether additional measures that can be obtained with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can further improve the MRI-guided discrimination between PD patients and controls. Our results show that the DESPOT1 method allows for a clear visualisation of the SN as a whole. Volumetric comparisons between ten PD patients and ten healthy subjects revealed significantly smaller volumes in patients for both the left and the right sides when the whole SN was considered. Combining SN volumetry and its connectivity with the thalamus improved the classification sensitivity to 100\% and specificity to 80\% for PD (discriminant function analysis with leave-one-out cross validation). Combining DESPOT1 imaging and DTI could therefore serve as a diagnostic marker for idiopathic Parkinson's disease in the future.},

Strengths of the UPDRS include its wide utilization, its application across the clinical spectrum of PD, its nearly comprehensive coverage of motor symptoms, and its clinimetric properties, including reliability and validity. Weaknesses include several ambiguities in the written text, inadequate instructions for raters, some metric flaws, and the absence of screening questions on several important non-motor aspects of PD. The Task Force recommends that the MDS sponsor the development of a new version of the UPDRS and encourage efforts to establish its clinimetric properties, especially addressing the need to define a Minimal Clinically Relevant Difference and a Minimal Clinically Relevant Incremental Difference, as well as testing its correlation with the current UPDRS. If developed, the new scale should be culturally unbiased and be tested in different racial, gender, and age-groups. Future goals should include the definition of UPDRS scores with confidence intervals that correlate with clinically pertinent designations, {\textquotedblleft}minimal,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}mild,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}moderate,{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}severe{\textquotedblright} PD. Whereas the presence of non-motor components of PD can be identified with screening questions, a new version of the UPDRS should include an official appendix that includes other, more detailed, and optionally used scales to determine severity of these impairments. {\textcopyright} 2003 Movement Disorder Society},

Despite several systematic reviews having summarised the evidence on diagnostic accuracy, the impact of imaging results on clinical utility has not been systematically assessed. Our objective was to examine the available evidence on the clinical utility of DaTscan imaging in changing diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with suspected PS. We performed a systematic review of published studies of clinical utility from 2000 to 2019 without language restrictions. A meta-analysis of change in diagnosis and management rates reported from each study was performed using a random-effects model and logit transformation. Sub-group analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was performed to explore heterogeneity. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen of these contributed to the meta-analyses including 950 and 779 patients with a reported change in management and change in diagnosis, respectively. The use of DaTscan imaging resulted in a change in management in 54\% (95\% CI: 47{\textendash}61\%) of patients. Change in diagnosis occurred in 31\% (95\% CI: 22{\textendash}42\%) of patients. The two pooled analyses were characterised by high levels of heterogeneity. Our systematic review and meta-analysis show that imaging with DaTscan was associated with a change in management in approximately half the patients tested and the diagnosis was modified in one third. Regardless of time from symptom onset to scan results, these changes were consistent. Further research focusing on specific patient subgroups could provide additional evidence on the impact on clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in five countries and three continents, which is still growing.},

	abstract = {Context An existing major challenge in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) research is the identification of biomarkers of disease progression. While magnetic resonance imaging is a potential source of PD biomarkers, none of the magnetic resonance imaging measures of PD are robust enough to warrant their adoption in clinical research. This study is part of a project that aims to replicate 11 PD studies reviewed in a recent survey (JAMA neurology, 78(10) 2021) to investigate the robustness of PD neuroimaging findings to data and analytical variations. Objective This study attempts to replicate the results in Hanganu et al. (Brain, 137(4) 2014) using data from the Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Methods Using 25 PD subjects and 18 healthy controls, we analyzed the rate of change of cortical thickness and of the volume of subcortical structures, and we measured the relationship between structural changes and cognitive decline. We compared our findings to the results in the original study. Results (1) Similarly to the original study, PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibited increased cortical thinning over time compared to patients without MCI in the right middle temporal gyrus, insula, and precuneus. (2) The rate of cortical thinning in the left inferior temporal and precentral gyri in PD patients correlated with the change in cognitive performance. (3) There were no group differences in the change of subcortical volumes. (4) We did not find a relationship between the change in subcortical volumes and the change in cognitive performance. Conclusion Despite important differences in the dataset used in this replication study, and despite differences in sample size, we were able to partially replicate the original results. We produced a publicly available reproducible notebook allowing researchers to further investigate the reproducibility of the results in Hanganu et al. (2014) when more data is added to PPMI.},

	abstract = {Resting-state fMRI is commonly used to derive brain parcellations, which are widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpreting human neuroscience studies. We previously developed a model that integrates local and global approaches for estimating areal-level cortical parcellations. The resulting local-global parcellations are often referred to as the Schaefer parcellations. However, the lack of homotopic correspondence between left and right Schaefer parcels has limited their use for brain lateralization studies. Here, we extend our previous model to derive homotopic areal-level parcellations. Using resting-fMRI and task-fMRI across diverse scanners, acquisition protocols, preprocessing and demographics, we show that the resulting homotopic parcellations are as homogeneous as the Schaefer parcellations, while being more homogeneous than five publicly available parcellations. Furthermore, weaker correlations between homotopic parcels are associated with greater lateralization in resting network organization, as well as lateralization in language and motor task activation. Finally, the homotopic parcellations agree with the boundaries of a number of cortical areas estimated from histology and visuotopic fMRI, while capturing sub-areal (e.g., somatotopic and visuotopic) features. Overall, these results suggest that the homotopic local-global parcellations represent neurobiologically meaningful subdivisions of the human cerebral cortex and will be a useful resource for future studies. Multi-resolution parcellations estimated from 1479 participants are publicly available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable\_projects/brain\_parcellation/Yan2023\_homotopic).},

	abstract = {White matter hyperintensities are a marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease that are strongly related to cognition in older adults. Similarly, medial temporal lobe atrophy is well-documented in aging and Alzheimer's disease and is associated with memory decline. Here, we assessed the relationship between lobar white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, and hippocampal memory in older adults. We collected MRI scans in a sample of 139 older adults without dementia (88 females, mean age (SD)~=~76.95 (10.61)). Participants were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses tested for associations among medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, regional white matter hyperintensities and memory, while adjusting for age, sex, and education and correcting for multiple comparisons. Increased occipital white matter hyperintensities were related to worse RAVLT delayed recall performance, and to reduced CA1, dentate gyrus, perirhinal cortex (Brodmann area 36), and parahippocampal cortex volumes. These medial temporal lobe subregional volumes were related to delayed recall performance. The association of occipital white matter hyperintensities with delayed recall performance was fully mediated statistically only by perirhinal cortex volume. These results suggest that white matter hyperintensities may be associated with memory decline through their impact on medial temporal lobe atrophy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vascular pathologies in memory loss in older adults and suggest that future studies should further examine the neural mechanisms of these relationships in longitudinal samples.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has a unique capability to delineate axonal tracts within the white matter, which has not been possible with previous noninvasive imaging techniques. In the past 10 years, we have witnessed a large increase in the use of DTI-based studies and a score of new anatomical knowledge and image analysis tools have been introduced in recent years. This review will provide an overview of the recent advancements in DTI-based studies and new image analysis tools.
RECENT FINDINGS: DTI provided new dimensions for the characterization of white matter anatomy. This characterization of the white matter can be roughly divided into two categories. First, the white matter can be parcellated into constituent white matter tracts, based on pixel-by-pixel orientation and anisotropy information. Second, the DTI information can be extrapolated to obtain three-dimensional connectivity information. Based on these capabilities of DTI, many new image analysis tools are being developed to investigate the status of the white matter.
SUMMARY: In the past, the white matter has often been treated as one compartment. With DTI and recently developed analysis tools, we can investigate the status of intra-white matter structures and deepen our understanding of white matter structures and their abnormalities under pathological conditions.},

At the same time, these developments have led to an increasing need for a high-resolution probabilistic in vivo anatomical atlas of subcortical nuclei. In order to address this need, we constructed high spatial resolution, three-dimensional templates, using high-accuracy diffeomorphic registration of T1- and T2- weighted structural images from 168 typical adults between 22 and 35 years old. In these templates, many tissue boundaries are clearly visible, which would otherwise be impossible to delineate in data from individual studies. The resulting delineations of subcortical nuclei complement current histology-based atlases. We further created a companion library of software tools for atlas development, to offer an open and evolving resource for the creation of a crowd-sourced in vivo probabilistic anatomical atlas of the human brain.},

	abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an increasingly important tool in mapping the functional networks of the brain. This tool has been used to examine network changes induced by cognitive and emotional states, neurological traits, and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, noise that remains in the rs-fMRI data after preprocessing has limited the reliability of individual-subject results, wherein scanner artifacts, subject movements, and other noise sources induce non-neural temporal correlations in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) timeseries. Numerous preprocessing methods have been proposed to isolate and remove these confounds; however, the field has not coalesced around a standard preprocessing pipeline. In comparisons, these preprocessing methods are often assessed with only a single metric of rs-fMRI data quality, such as reliability, without considering other aspects in tandem, such as signal-to-noise ratio and group discriminability. The present study seeks to identify the data preprocessing pipeline that optimizes rs-fMRI data across multiple outcome measures. Specifically, we aim to minimize the noise in the data and maximize result reliability, while retaining the unique features that characterize distinct groups. We examine how these metrics are influenced by bandpass filter selection and noise regression in four datasets, totaling 181 rs-fMRI scans and 38 subject-driven memory scans. Additionally, we perform two different rs-fMRI analysis methods {\textendash} dual regression and region-of-interest based functional connectivity {\textendash} and highlight the preprocessing parameters that optimize both approaches. Our results expand upon previous reports of individual-scan reliability, and demonstrate that preprocessing parameter selection can significantly change the noisiness, reliability, and heterogeneity of rs-fMRI data. The application of our findings to rs-fMRI data analysis should improve the validity and reliability of rs-fMRI results, both at the individual-subject level and the group level.},

In the last 10 years neuroscience spawned quantitative big-sample datasets on microanatomy, synaptic connections, optogenetic brain-behavior assays, and high-level cognition. While growing data availability and information granularity have been amply discussed, we direct attention to a routinely neglected question: How will the unprecedented data richness shape data analysis practices? Statistical reasoning is becoming more central to distill neurobiological knowledge from healthy and pathological brain recordings. We believe that large-scale data analysis will use more models that are non-parametric, generative, mixing frequentist and Bayesian aspects, and grounded in different statistical inferences.},

Here we describe some ongoing and possible future interactions among the massive data sets being collected in neuroscience, methods for their analysis and mathematical models of the underlying, still largely uncharted neural substrates that generate these data. We start by recalling events that occurred in turbulence modelling when substantial space-time velocity field measurements and numerical simulations allowed a new perspective on the governing equations of fluid mechanics. While no analogous global mathematical model of neural processes exists, we argue that big data may enable validation or at least rejection of models at cellular to brain area scales and may illuminate connections among models. We give examples of such models and survey some relatively new experimental technologies, including optogenetics and functional imaging, that can report neural activity in live animals performing complex tasks. The search for analytical techniques for these data is already yielding new mathematics, and we believe their multi-scale nature may help relate well-established models, such as the Hodgkin{\textendash}Huxley equations for single neurons, to more abstract models of neural circuits, brain areas and larger networks within the brain. In brief, we envisage a closer liaison, if not a marriage, between neuroscience and mathematics.},

	abstract = {Clinical manifestations and evolution are very heterogeneous among individuals with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD). The aims of this study were to investigate the pattern of progressive brain atrophy in PD according to disease stage and to elucidate to what extent cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy are related to clinical motor and non-motor evolution. 154 patients at different PD stages were assessed over time using motor, non-motor and structural MRI evaluations for a maximum of 4 years. Cluster analysis defined clinical subtypes. Cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy were assessed at baseline in patients relative to 60 healthy controls. Longitudinal trends of brain atrophy progression were compared between PD clusters. The contribution of brain atrophy in predicting motor, non-motor, cognitive and mood deterioration was explored. Two main PD clusters were defined: mild (N = 87) and moderate-to-severe (N = 67). Two mild subtypes were further identified: mild motor-predominant (N = 43) and mild-diffuse (N = 44), with the latter group being older and having more severe non-motor and cognitive symptoms. The initial pattern of brain atrophy was more severe in patients with moderate-to-severe PD. Over time, mild-diffuse PD patients had the greatest brain atrophy accumulation in the cortex and the left hippocampus, while less distributed atrophy progression was observed in moderate-to-severe and mild motor-predominant patients. Baseline and 1-year cortical thinning was associated with long-term progression of motor, cognitive, non-motor and mood symptoms. Cortical and subcortical atrophy is accelerated early after the onset of PD and becomes prominent in later stages of disease according to the development of cognitive, non-motor and mood dysfunctions. Structural MRI may be useful for monitoring and predicting disease progression in PD.},

	abstract = {The basal forebrain contains several interdigitating anatomical structures, including the diagonal band of Broca, the basal nucleus of Meynert, the ventral striatum, and also cell groups underneath the globus pallidus that bridge the centromedial amygdala to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Among the cell populations, the magnocellular, cholinergic corticopetal projection neurons have received particular attention due to their loss in Alzheimer's disease. In MRI images, the precise delineation of these structures is difficult due to limited spatial resolution and contrast. Here, using microscopic delineations in ten human postmortem brains, we present stereotaxic probabilistic maps of the basal forebrain areas containing the magnocellular cell groups. Cytoarchitectonic mapping was performed in silver stained histological serial sections. The positions and the extent of the magnocellular cell groups within the septum (Ch1-2), the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (Ch3), and in the sublenticular part of the basal forebrain (Ch4) were traced in high-resolution digitized histological sections, 3D reconstructed, and warped to the reference space of the MNI single subject brain. The superposition of the cytoarchitectonic maps in the MNI brain shows the intersubject variability of the various Ch compartments and their stereotaxic position relative to other brain structures. Both the right and left Ch4 regions showed significantly smaller volumes when age was considered as a covariate. Probabilistic maps of compartments of the basal forebrain magnocellular system are now available as an open source reference for correlation with fMRI, PET, and structural MRI data of the living human brain.},

Friedrich Lewy first observed his eponymous inclusion bodies in the nbM of postmortem brain tissue from patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) and cell loss in this area can be at least as extensive as that seen in AD. There has been confusion with regard to the terminology and exact localisation of the nbM within the human basal forebrain for decades due to the diffuse and broad structure of this {\textquotedblleft}nucleus{\textquotedblright}. Also, while topographical projections from the nbM have been mapped out in subhuman primates, no direct clinicopathological correlations between subregional nbM and cortical pathology and specific cognitive profile decline have been performed in human tissue. Here, we review the evolution of the term nbM and the importance of standardised nbM sampling for neuropathological studies. Extensive review of the literature suggests that there is a caudorostral pattern of neuronal loss within the nbM in AD brains. However, the findings in PD are less clear due to the limited number of studies performed. Given the differing neuropsychiatric and cognitive deficits in Lewy body-associated dementias (PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies) as compared to AD, we hypothesise that a different pattern of neuronal loss will be found in the nbM of Lewy body disease brains. Understanding the functional significance of the subregions of the nbM could prove important in elucidating the pathogenesis of dementia in PD.},

Quantitative in-vivo assessment of the cerebellum is important in the study of several neurological diseases including cerebellar ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. Different structural subdivisions of the cerebellum have been shown to correlate with differing pathologies. To further understand these pathologies, it is helpful to automatically parcellate the cerebellum at the highest fidelity possible. In this paper, we coordinated with colleagues around the world to evaluate automated cerebellum parcellation algorithms on two clinical cohorts showing that the cerebellum can be parcellated to a high accuracy by newer methods. We characterize these various methods at four hierarchical levels: coarse (i.e., whole cerebellum and gross structures), lobe, subdivisions of the vermis, and the lobules. Due to the number of labels, the hierarchy of labels, the number of algorithms, and the two cohorts, we have restricted our analyses to the Dice measure of overlap. Under these conditions, machine learning based methods provide a collection of strategies that are efficient and deliver parcellations of a high standard across both cohorts, surpassing previous work in the area. In conjunction with the rank-sum computation, we identified an overall winning method.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a method to segment four brainstem structures (midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata and superior cerebellar peduncle) from 3D brain MRI scans. The segmentation method relies on a probabilistic atlas of the brainstem and its neighboring brain structures. To build the atlas, we combined a dataset of 39 scans with already existing manual delineations of the whole brainstem and a dataset of 10 scans in which the brainstem structures were manually labeled with a protocol that was specifically designed for this study. The resulting atlas can be used in a Bayesian framework to segment the brainstem structures in novel scans. Thanks to the generative nature of the scheme, the segmentation method is robust to changes in MRI contrast or acquisition hardware. Using cross validation, we show that the algorithm can segment the structures in previously unseen T1 and FLAIR scans with great accuracy (mean error under 1mm) and robustness (no failures in 383 scans including 168 AD cases). We also indirectly evaluate the algorithm with a experiment in which we study the atrophy of the brainstem in aging. The results show that, when used simultaneously, the volumes of the midbrain, pons and medulla are significantly more predictive of age than the volume of the entire brainstem, estimated as their sum. The results also demonstrate that the method can detect atrophy patterns in the brainstem structures that have been previously described in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to detect differential effects of AD on the brainstem structures. The method will be implemented as part of the popular neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.03.001},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical imaging data are typically stored and transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community. Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some variations can disrupt this process.
NEW METHOD: We provide some insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First, different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion. Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the DICOM conversion.
RESULTS: We present results in several error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction, effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry correction for some imaging modality.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Conversion tools are often designed for a specific manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This also serves as an overview for developers who wish to either develop their own tools or adapt the open source tools created by the authors.},

	abstract = {We propose a new perceptual super resolution (PSR) method for 3D neuroimaging and evaluate its performance in detecting brain changes due to neurodegenerative disease. The method, concurrent super resolution and segmentation (CSRS), is trained on volumetric brain data to consistently upsample both an image intensity channel and associated segmentation labels. The simultaneous nature of the method improves not only the resolution of the images but also the resolution of associated segmentations thereby making the approach directly applicable to existing labeled datasets. One challenge to real world evaluation of SR methods such as CSRS is the lack of high resolution ground truth in the target application data: clinical neuroimages. We therefore evaluate CSRS effectiveness in an adjacent, clinically relevant signal detection problem: quantifying cross-sectional and longitudinal change across a set of phenotypically heterogeneous but related disorders that exhibit known and differentiable patterns of brain atrophy. We contrast several 3D PSR loss functions in this paradigm and show that CSRS consistently increases the ability to detect regional atrophy both longitudinally and cross-sectionally in each of five related diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNoneAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study used (or will use) ONLY openly available human data that were originally located at: https://ida.loni.usc.edu/ (in particular 4RTNI, NIFD), PPMI https://www.ppmi-info.org and http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/data/ Further details are in the manuscript.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

The current pilot study was initiated in partnership with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to explore whether neuroinflammation is seen within special operators with prior blast exposure. Data were analyzed from 18 service members (SMs), inclusive of 9 blast-exposed special operators with an extensive career history of repeated blast exposures and 9 controls matched by age and duration of service. Neuroinflammation was assessed utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [18F]DPA-714. Serum was acquired to assess inflammatory biomarkers within whole serum and BDEVs. The Blast Exposure Threshold Survey (BETS) was acquired to determine blast history. Both self-report and neurocognitive measures were acquired to assess cognition. Similarity-driven Multi-view Linear Reconstruction (SiMLR) was used for joint analysis of acquired data. Analysis of BDEVs indicated significant positive associations with a generalized blast exposure value (GBEV) derived from the BETS. SiMLR-based analyses of neuroimaging demonstrated exposure-related relationships between GBEV, PET-neuroinflammation, cortical thickness, and volume loss within special operators. Affected brain networks included regions associated with memory retrieval and executive functioning, as well as visual and heteromodal processing. Post hoc assessments of cognitive measures failed to demonstrate significant associations with GBEV. This emerging evidence suggests neuroinflammation may be a key feature of the brain response to blast exposure over a career in operational personnel. The common thread of neuroinflammation observed in blast-exposed populations requires further study.},

	abstract = {Diverse, high-dimensional modalities collected in large cohorts present new opportunities for the formulation and testing of integrative scientific hypotheses. Similarity-driven multi-view linear reconstruction (SiMLR) is an algorithm that exploits inter-modality relationships to transform large scientific datasets into smaller, more well-powered and interpretable low-dimensional spaces. SiMLR contributes an objective function to identify joint signal regularization based on sparse matrices representing prior within-modality relationships and an implementation that permits application to joint reduction of large data matrices. We demonstrate that SiMLR outperlforms closely related methods on supervised learning problems in simulation data, a multi-omics cancer survival prediction dataset and multiple modality neuroimaging datasets. Taken together, this collection of results shows that SiMLR may be applied to joint signal estimation from disparate modalities and may yield practically useful results in a variety of application domains.},

	abstract = {Background Uncontrollable body movements are typical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), which results in inconsistent findings regarding resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) networks, especially for group difference clusters. Systematically identifying the motion-associated data was highly demanded. Purpose To determine data censoring criteria using a quantitative cross validation-based data censoring (CVDC) method and to improve the detection of rsFC deficits in PD. Study Type Prospective. Subjects Forty-one PD patients (68.63 {\textpm} 9.17 years, 44\% female) and 20 healthy controls (66.83 {\textpm} 12.94 years, 55\% female). Field Strength/Sequence 3-T, T1-weighted gradient echo and EPI sequences. Assessment Clusters with significant differences between groups were found in three visual networks, default network, and right sensorimotor network. Five-fold cross-validation tests were performed using multiple motion exclusion criteria, and the selected criteria were determined based on cluster sizes, significance values, and Dice coefficients among the cross-validation tests. As a reference method, whole brain rsFC comparisons between groups were analyzed using a FMRIB Software Library (FSL) pipeline with default settings. Statistical Tests Group difference clusters were calculated using nonparametric permutation statistics of FSL-randomize. The family-wise error was corrected. Demographic information was evaluated using independent sample t-tests and Pearson's Chi-squared tests. The level of statistical significance was set at P {\textless} 0.05. Results With the FSL processing pipeline, the mean Dice coefficient of the network clusters was 0.411, indicating a low reproducibility. With the proposed CVDC method, motion exclusion criteria were determined as frame-wise displacement {\textgreater}0.55 mm. Group-difference clusters showed a mean P-value of 0.01 and a 72\% higher mean Dice coefficient compared to the FSL pipeline. Furthermore, the CVDC method was capable of detecting subtle rsFC deficits in the medial sensorimotor network and auditory network that were unobservable using the conventional pipeline. Data Conclusion The CVDC method may provide superior sensitivity and improved reproducibility for detecting rsFC deficits in PD. Level of Evidence 1 Technical Efficacy Stage 2},

	abstract = {Background
Once considered mere noise, fMRI-based functional connectivity has become a major neuroscience tool in part due to early studies demonstrating its reliability. These fundamental studies revealed only the tip of the iceberg; over the past decade, many test-retest reliability studies have continued to add nuance to our understanding of this complex topic. A summary of these diverse and at times contradictory perspectives is needed.
Objectives
We aimed to summarize the existing knowledge regarding test-retest reliability of functional connectivity at the most basic unit of analysis: the individual edge level. This entailed (1) a meta-analytic estimate of reliability and (2) a review of factors influencing reliability.
Methods
A search of Scopus was conducted to identify studies that estimated edge-level test-retest reliability. To facilitate comparisons across studies, eligibility was restricted to studies measuring reliability via the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The meta-analysis included a random effects pooled estimate of mean edge-level ICC, with studies nested within datasets. The review included a narrative summary of factors influencing edge-level ICC.
Results
From an initial pool of 212 studies, 44 studies were identified for the qualitative review and 25 studies for quantitative meta-analysis. On average, individual edges exhibited a {\textquotedblleft}poor{\textquotedblright} ICC of 0.29 (95\% CI = 0.23 to 0.36). The most reliable measurements tended to involve: (1) stronger, within-network, cortical edges, (2) eyes open, awake, and active recordings, (3) more within-subject data, (4) shorter test-retest intervals, (5) no artifact correction (likely due in part to reliable artifact), and (6) full correlation-based connectivity with shrinkage.
Conclusion
This study represents the first meta-analysis and systematic review investigating test-retest reliability of edge-level functional connectivity. Key findings suggest there is room for improvement, but care should be taken to avoid promoting reliability at the expense of validity. By pooling existing knowledge regarding this key facet of accuracy, this study supports broader efforts to improve inferences in the field.},

	abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are sensitive to artefacts caused by in-scanner head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of numerous denoising methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts. Here, we compare popular retrospective rs-fMRI denoising methods, such as regression of head motion parameters and mean white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (with and without expansion terms), aCompCor, volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global signal regression and ICA-AROMA, combined into 19 different pipelines. These pipelines were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in four independent datasets associated with varying levels of motion. Pipelines were benchmarked by examining the residual relationship between in-scanner movement and functional connectivity after denoising; the effect of distance on this residual relationship; whole-brain differences in functional connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls (HC); the temporal degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity of each pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in independent samples of people with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our results indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional fMRI time series against head motion parameters and WM/CSF signals (with or without expansion terms) is not sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2) aCompCor pipelines may only be viable in low-motion data; (3) volume censoring performs well at minimising motion-related artefact but a major benefit of this approach derives from the exclusion of high-motion individuals; (4) while not as effective as volume censoring, ICA-AROMA performed well across our benchmarks for relatively low cost in terms of data loss; (5) the addition of global signal regression improved the performance of nearly all pipelines on most benchmarks, but exacerbated the distance-dependence of correlations between motion and functional connectivity; and (6) group comparisons in functional connectivity between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are highly dependent on preprocessing strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and outline simple analyses to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to which a given set of findings may be affected by motion-related artefact.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Functional MRI has played a fundamental role in Parkinson's disease(PD) study. In this paper, we performed an independent component analysis (ICA) based on functional networks to reveal the intricate variations on the morphology and functional properties of brain. Our analysis aims at discovering the differences between PD patients with sensorimotor function impairment and normal controls(NC), thus helping to understand the coordination neurological function degeneration in PD objectively.
Method
We investigated the blood oxygen level dependent(BOLD) functional MRI obtained at a 3.0 T MRI scanner. 30 PD patients and 28 NC subjects underwent the scan in resting state. The signals of sensory and motor coordinative control areas in the sensorimotor, insula and cerebellum networks acquired by ICA(Independent Component Analysis)were applied to analyze the functional alterations. Specifically, intra-network analysis was performed with signals in local networks, and inter-network analysis was conducted by functional network connectivity (FNC) with signals across different networks. Two sample T test was carried out to detect the significant (p {\textless} 0.05, FDR p {\textless} 0.05) functional abnormality in PD patients.
Conclusion
We identified an obvious increase in bilateral posterior insula, but decrease in bilateral cerebellum hemisphere, supplementary motor area(SMA) and precentral gyrus paracentral lobule of left postcentral gyrus. Besides, we found a significantly increased connection between independent component (IC) 13 which was located in right postcentral gyrus and cerebellum. Decreased connections were detected between sensory and motor cortex in sensorimotor network and between cerebellum and insula network by FNC analysis in PD patients as well.
Discussion
Parkinson's disease derives from the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra, and results in decreased secretion of inhibitory neurotransmitter. The significant differences between PD and NC groups in our research maybe explain the clinical manifestations of prominent bradykinesia and multiple extrapyramidal symptoms.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging techniques provide important insight into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) in-vivo. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been applied as a non-invasive tool in many studies to assess functional abnormalities observed in PD without the effects of particular motor or cognitive tasks. In this review, we summarized 50 original PD rs-fMRI studies and subdivided them based on the medication status of the patients to highlight the impact of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) when rs-fMRI was used to assess patients with PD. Although there are many different published approaches to analyzing rs-fMRI in PD, it seems that DRT plays a critical role in the functional reorganization of the brain throughout all of these approaches. In particular, studies that compared PD patients with and without medication demonstrated that DRT normalizes aberrant functional patterns in PD and leads to an improvement of PD symptoms. Thus, researchers should consider DRT as a confounding factor, which could result in misinterpretations. We suggest that performing rs-fMRI in de novo patients could be a method of choice to study the fundamental functional abnormalities in PD independent of the effects of DRT. However, it is necessary to carefully control for excessive involuntary head motions in the patients not receiving DRT. On the other hand, recruiting patients under daily DRT might be favorable to assess particular interventions in clinical routine.},

These fluctuations are organized as functional connectivity networks called resting-state networks, anatomically corresponding to specific neuronal circuits. As Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease is mainly characterized by a dysfunction of the sensorimotor pathways, which can be influenced by levodopa administration, the present study investigated the functional connectivity changes within the sensorimotor resting-state network in drug-na{\"i}ve patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease after acute levodopa administration. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in 20 drug-na{\"i}ve patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease, immediately before and 60 min after, oral administration of either levodopa or placebo. Control resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were recorded in 18 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Independent component analysis was performed to extract resting-state network maps and associated time-course spectral features. At the anatomical level, levodopa enhanced the sensorimotor network functional connectivity in the supplementary motor area, a region where drug-na{\"i}ve patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease exhibited reduced signal fluctuations compared with untreated patients. At the spectral frequency level, levodopa stimulated these fluctuations in a selective frequency band of the sensorimotor network. The reported effects induced by levodopa on sensorimotor network topological and spectral features confirm that the sensorimotor system is a target of acute levodopa administration in drug-na{\"i}ve patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease. Moreover, while the regional changes in supplementary motor area reflect the functional improvement in motor function, the rhythm-specific modulation induced by the dopamine precursor discloses a novel aspect of pharmacological stimulation in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease, adding further insight to the comprehension of levodopa action.},

	abstract = {The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) measures resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) signal of each voxel. However, the unit of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is arbitrary and hence ALFF is sensitive to the scale of raw signal. A well-accepted standardization procedure is to divide each voxel{\textquoteright}s ALFF by the global mean ALFF, named mALFF. Although fractional ALFF (fALFF), a ratio of the ALFF to the total amplitude within the full frequency band, offers possible solution of the standardization, it actually mixes with the fluctuation power within the full frequency band and thus cannot reveal the true amplitude characteristics of a given frequency band. The current study borrowed the percent signal change in task fMRI studies and proposed percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) for RS-fMRI. We firstly applied PerAF and mPerAF (i.e., divided by global mean PerAF) to eyes open (EO) vs. eyes closed (EC) RS-fMRI data. PerAF and mPerAF yielded prominently difference between EO and EC, being well consistent with previous studies. We secondly performed test-retest reliability analysis and found that (PerAF ? mPerAF ? mALFF) {\textgreater} (fALFF ? mfALFF). Head motion regression (Friston-24) increased the reliability of PerAF, but decreased all other metrics (e.g. mPerAF, mALFF, fALFF, and mfALFF). The above results suggest that mPerAF is a valid, more reliable, more straightforward, and hence a promising metric for voxel-level RS-fMRI studies. Future study could use both PerAF and mPerAF metrics. For prompting future application of PerAF, we implemented PerAF in a new version of REST package named RESTplus.},

These central nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This work uses machine learning techniques~ to derive such a quantitative marker from T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods: In this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based disease specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank.Findings:  1,826 dementia images from 731 participants and 3,161 healthy controls images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 participants and 232 healthy controls{\textquoteright} images from 145 participants from PPMI cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification performance is 0.94 [95\% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD detection and 0.63 [95\% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus and temporal brain regions in ADRD~ and the substantia nigra in PD. The normalized ML model{\textquoteright}s probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from UK Biobank. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95\% CI: 0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95\% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score is strongly associated with dementia free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95\% CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95\% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in the future.Interpretation:  Our study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression.

Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74\%{\textendash}85\%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.

Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This paper details the organization of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed.},

The BraTS-Reg challenge intends to establish a public benchmark environment for deformable registration algorithms. The associated dataset comprises de-identified multi-institutional multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) data, curated for each scan's size and resolution, according to a common anatomical template. Clinical experts have generated extensive annotations of landmarks points within the scans, descriptive of distinct anatomical locations across the temporal domain. The training data along with these ground truth annotations will be released to participants to design and develop their registration algorithms, whereas the annotations for the validation and the testing data will be withheld by the organizers and used to evaluate the containerized algorithms of the participants.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis.
DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections.
DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
It has been recently suggested that LRRK2 mutations are associated with a more benign clinical phenotype and a potentially more preserved cholinergic function in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, to our knowledge, no studies have tested whether the better clinical progression observed in LRRK2-PD patients is associated with more preserved volumes of a cholinergic brain area, the basal forebrain (BF). To address this hypothesis, here we compared BF volumes in LRRK2 carriers with and without PD with respect to idiopathic PD (iPD) patients and controls, and assessed whether they are associated with better clinical progression observed in LRRK2-PD compared to iPD.
Methods
Thirty-one symptomatic LRRK2-PD patients and 13 asymptomatic LRRK2 individuals were included from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In addition, 31 patients with iPD and 13 healthy controls matched to the previous groups were also included. BF volumes were automatically extracted from baseline T1-weighted MRI scans using a stereotactic atlas of cholinergic nuclei. These volumes were then compared between groups and their relationship with longitudinal cognitive changes was evaluated using linear mixed effects models. Mediation analyses assessed whether BF volumes mediated differences in cognitive trajectories between groups.
Results
LRRK2-PD patients showed significantly higher BF volumes compared to iPD (P~=~0.019) as did asymptomatic LRRK2 subjects compared to controls (P~=~0.008). There were no other significant differences in cortical regions or subcortical volumes between these groups. BF volumes predicted longitudinal decline in several cognitive functions in iPD patients but not in LRRK2-PD, who did not show cognitive changes over a 4-year follow-up period. BF volumes were a significant mediator of the different cognitive trajectories between iPD and LRRK2-PD patients (95\% CI 0.056{\textendash}2.955).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that mutations in LRRK2 are associated with increased BF volumes, potentially reflecting a compensatory hypercholinergic state that could prevent cognitive decline in LRRK2-PD patients.},

Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package).

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

	abstract = {Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling disorder that often affects Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) patients in advanced stages of the disease. To study structural gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) changes in PD patients with and without FOG, twenty-one PD patients with FOG (PD-FOG), 16 PD patients without FOG (PD-nFOG) and 19 healthy subjects (HS) underwent a standardized MRI protocol. For the gray matter evaluation, cortical volume (CV), cortical thickness (CTh), and surface area (SA) were analyzed using the FreeSurfer pipeline. For the white matter evaluation, DTI images were analyzed using tracts constrained by underlying anatomy (TRACULA) toolbox in FreeSurfer. PD-FOG patients exhibited lower CTh than HS in the mesial surface of both cerebral hemispheres, including the superior frontal gyrus, paracentral lobule, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and pericalcarine cortex, and in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, significant WM changes were observed in PD-FOG patients in comparison with HS in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum cingulate gyrus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (prevalently in the right hemisphere) and in the frontal radiations of the corpus callosum. DTI abnormalities in specific WM bundles correlated significantly with cognitive measures. The damage of multiple cortical areas involved in high-level gait control together with WM disruption between motor, cognitive and limbic structures may represent the anatomical correlate of FOG.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers a unique window on the connectivity changes, extending beyond the basal ganglia, which accompany the cognitive symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD). The primary purpose of this study was to assess the microstructural damage to cerebral white matter occurring in idiopathic PD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our sample included patients with PD without dementia (n = 10; Hoehn and Yahr stages I and II; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, 20.5 {\textpm} 8.3; and Mini-Mental State Examination, 28.3 {\textpm} 1.5) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 10). DTI was performed on a 1.5T scanner, and mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were obtained. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the major fiber bundles as well as on gray matter nuclei.
RESULTS: In patients, the MD was increased at borderline significance in the substantia nigra but was unaltered in the thalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, and in the head of the caudate nucleus. The FA and MD were unaltered in the corticospinal tract in the midbrain and at the level of the internal capsule, and in the splenium of the corpus callosum. By contrast, the MD was increased and the FA was decreased in the genu of the corpus callosum and in the superior longitudinal fasciculus; in the cingulum, only the MD was altered. The observed changes were not significantly lateralized.
CONCLUSIONS: Widespread microstructural damage to frontal and parietal white matter occurs already in the early stages of PD.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of aging. The hallmark pathophysiology includes the development of neuronal Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra of the midbrain with subsequent loss of dopaminergic neurons. These neuronal losses lead to the characteristic motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor. In addition to these cardinal motor symptoms patients with PD experience a wide range of non-motor symptoms, the most important being cognitive impairments that in many circumstances lead to dementia. People with PD experience a wide range of cognitive impairments; in this review we will focus on memory impairment in PD and specifically episodic memory, which are memories of day-to-day events of life. Importantly, these memory impairments severely impact the lives of patients and caregivers alike. Traditionally episodic memory is considered to be markedly dependent on the hippocampus; therefore, it is important to understand the exact nature of PD episodic memory deficits in relation to hippocampal function and dysfunction. In this review, we discuss an aspect of episodic memory called recognition memory and its subcomponents called recollection and familiarity. Recognition memory is believed to be impaired in PD; thus, we discuss what aspects of the hippocampus are expected to be deficient in function as they relate to these recognition memory impairments. In addition to the hippocampus as a whole, we will discuss the role of hippocampal subfields in recognition memory impairments.},
